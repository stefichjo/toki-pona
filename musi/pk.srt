687
01:24:43,152 --> 01:24:50,472
that crow is sitting naked. looks weird to you?
it be weird if will wear a tie.

688
01:24:52,517 --> 01:24:59,820
PK i kept thinking whole night
how to get back your remote from tapasvi.

689
01:25:00,215 --> 01:25:04,025
-hello!
-hello, connect me to balbir singh room no. 4.

690
01:25:04,025 --> 01:25:06,695
wrong number.

691
01:25:06,723 --> 01:25:10,930
-its not fortis hospital?
-I have been telling you since yesterday
its a wrong number.

692
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:15,295
-how could it be wrong number.
I myself saved it in the mobile phone.

693
01:25:16,009 --> 01:25:18,580
so what did you think?

694
01:25:21,723 --> 01:25:25,007
hello connect to balbir singh, room no. 4

695
01:25:25,007 --> 01:25:30,295
you called so late, he died this morning.

696
01:25:30,453 --> 01:25:31,653
what?

697
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,086
but how could someone die in
haemorrhoids operation?

698
01:25:35,086 --> 01:25:42,621
yeah that's strange. but ok we will write in
death certificate it was heart attack.
family reputation should not be spoiled.

699
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:47,051
-come take the body.
-yes yes..umm on my...
-BYE.

700
01:25:49,501 --> 01:25:50,771
why you said that?

701
01:25:51,009 --> 01:25:57,185
spreading happiness.
He will have a good surprise once he'll see
his friend alive.

702
01:25:58,151 --> 01:26:02,433
I fed up with his wrong numbers.
so just duped him.

703
01:26:02,739 --> 01:26:03,358
duped?

704
01:26:04,104 --> 01:26:05,866
PK i was just kidding.

705
01:26:15,116 --> 01:26:17,434
I understood now the whole case.

706
01:26:17,655 --> 01:26:18,847
Someone is duping.

707
01:26:19,147 --> 01:26:24,385
whoever dials God's number for trouble via tapasvi
never reaches God cuz he is duping everyone.

708
01:26:25,242 --> 01:26:27,567
Tapasvi ji is a fraud here.
who dials wrong number.

709
01:26:28,163 --> 01:26:30,877
and someone sitting above is duping people.
who is not a God.

710
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:34,978
otherwise why would God call my remote
their property?

711
01:26:36,671 --> 01:26:37,814
I feel..

712
01:26:38,528 --> 01:26:43,433
..the communication system between God and people
in this planet is completely wrenched.

713
01:26:43,496 --> 01:26:46,820
that's why all managers ( gurus) call is going
to a wrong number.

714
01:26:46,972 --> 01:26:47,544
meaning?

715
01:26:47,544 --> 01:26:51,639
that's why god was giving me illogical
solutions to my problems.

716
01:26:52,543 --> 01:26:57,189
Sometimes he say come to my house rolling
on the road then i will do your work.

717
01:26:57,189 --> 01:26:58,909
now tell me aren't we god's children?

718
01:26:59,401 --> 01:27:04,515
so normal parents would never tell their
kids to do such horrible things.

719
01:27:04,948 --> 01:27:10,349
your father ever told you if you
need a new dress you should roll on
the floor?

720
01:27:10,727 --> 01:27:14,997
sometimes says shower me with cow's milk
everyday. how illogical.

721
01:27:15,346 --> 01:27:20,315
Pk..if these cals would have reached the right number..

722
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:22,108
..then what would he say?

723
01:27:22,424 --> 01:27:28,706
he would have said give milk and food to the
poor people.

724
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:31,600
..why on earth you showering me with milk?

725
01:27:31,648 --> 01:27:34,965
I am sure someone is duping people like
you did on phone.

726
01:27:35,346 --> 01:27:40,029
Pk thought tapasvi was honest.
but i didn't say a word.

727
01:27:40,457 --> 01:27:43,124
i had an idea..

728
01:27:43,394 --> 01:27:45,886
an idea that would get PK's remote.

729
01:27:48,267 --> 01:27:49,409
who is this PK?

730
01:27:49,917 --> 01:27:51,457
his identity is unknown.

731
01:27:52,173 --> 01:27:54,347
but he has a unique imagination.

732
01:27:55,284 --> 01:27:56,506
mean?
- it means that..

733
01:27:57,205 --> 01:28:01,062
if he'll spot you smoking
he'll call police saying you are doing suicide.

734
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:04,633
because packet states "smoking kills"

735
01:28:06,982 --> 01:28:07,903
what is the point?

736
01:28:10,649 --> 01:28:15,094
War.
I want to collide tapasvi ji with PK on tv.

737
01:28:15,601 --> 01:28:17,792
it will be a one on one debate.

738
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:23,975
jaggu..
i already have marks on my right butt.

739
01:28:25,229 --> 01:28:27,784
do you want it to be balanced out
on the left butt too?

740
01:28:28,197 --> 01:28:32,800
No.
the highlight of this debate will be
that PK will not fight with tapasvi.

741
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:38,276
Pk will just explain nicely that their
prayers are going to a wrong number.

742
01:28:38,276 --> 01:28:40,901
tapasvi will have no idea how to
answer him.

743
01:28:41,689 --> 01:28:45,848
cherry..cherry..
he is here. just meet him once.

744
01:28:46,562 --> 01:28:50,641
I challenge you, even you
can't take away his confusions.
trust me. please.

745
01:29:01,832 --> 01:29:04,050
it fell from your pocket.

746
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,832
its not mine.

747
01:29:11,975 --> 01:29:14,118
kamasutra, strawberry flavor.

748
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:17,737
I hate strawberries man.

749
01:29:18,165 --> 01:29:21,594
ask someone else. its not mine.
what a weirdo.

750
01:29:24,467 --> 01:29:26,165
is it yours?
-How dare you?

751
01:29:26,911 --> 01:29:30,038
- check your purse maybe something i missing.
- dickhead.

752
01:29:31,673 --> 01:29:35,673
- uncle is it yours?
- No not mine.

753
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:40,530
Pk. that's his.
whatever you want to ask, ask him.

754
01:29:42,716 --> 01:29:43,494
come.

755
01:29:45,748 --> 01:29:46,605
what's this?

756
01:29:48,272 --> 01:29:49,399
its condom.

757
01:29:50,066 --> 01:29:51,082
what's it use?

758
01:29:51,399 --> 01:29:53,510
it controls world population.

759
01:29:55,462 --> 01:29:56,097
how?

760
01:29:57,050 --> 01:29:58,336
by  putting it on.

761
01:29:59,815 --> 01:30:01,196
..while having sex.

762
01:30:03,878 --> 01:30:06,847
how  is it controlled
if you'd put it?

763
01:30:07,116 --> 01:30:10,148
Not if i put it on.
millions of people wear it.

764
01:30:10,529 --> 01:30:12,434
do you give this everyone?

765
01:30:12,926 --> 01:30:14,148
everyone got it.

766
01:30:14,814 --> 01:30:15,847
I have a question.

767
01:30:16,084 --> 01:30:17,830
please go ahead PK.

768
01:30:18,957 --> 01:30:23,052
When money is dropped,
everyone claims its mine.

769
01:30:23,211 --> 01:30:27,989
..but when condom drops,
everyone denies. why so?

770
01:30:29,148 --> 01:30:31,544
buddy sex is a very private subject.

771
01:30:31,894 --> 01:30:32,640
why?

772
01:30:32,798 --> 01:30:35,735
nobody announces the world that today
i am having sex.

773
01:30:36,385 --> 01:30:45,639
then why in marriages..everyone announces the
whole town with firecrackers & loud speakers..
that today i will have sex.

774
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:50,741
what happened?

775
01:30:50,963 --> 01:30:52,915
I dont have a reply to that.

776
01:30:53,296 --> 01:30:55,360
..but i do have a job for you.

777
01:30:58,661 --> 01:31:01,566
lets leave before he changes his mind.

778
01:31:04,978 --> 01:31:09,264
you better hide your butt now tapasvi,
because my trishul (weapon) has launched.

779
01:31:14,518 --> 01:31:18,930
Pk..tapasvi ji meets everyday with their follower
here. and pass their messages to God.

780
01:31:19,343 --> 01:31:22,312
we'll go in and listen to their phone calls.

781
01:31:22,534 --> 01:31:28,915
the moment you feel the calls are reaching
wrong number, you start explaining
tapasvi ji.

782
01:31:29,248 --> 01:31:31,201
then he'll return my remote?

783
01:31:31,248 --> 01:31:38,455
the day he'll understand someone is duping,
and that object is not god's.
he should return it.

784
01:31:40,024 --> 01:31:41,151
ok i will explain.

785
01:31:42,961 --> 01:31:49,358
to make someone's house is virtue.
and to make god's house is the greatest virtue.

786
01:31:50,374 --> 01:31:52,247
donate in abundance.

787
01:31:53,247 --> 01:31:55,643
and get rid of all your troubles.

788
01:31:56,564 --> 01:31:58,977
say it devotee. what bothers you?

789
01:32:01,469 --> 01:32:05,358
tapasvi ji..my wife is paralysed since 6 months..

790
01:32:06,279 --> 01:32:08,231
doctors can't help her..

791
01:32:08,644 --> 01:32:10,374
i want that you..

792
01:32:10,395 --> 01:32:10,895


793
01:32:11,581 --> 01:32:15,041
God, show him the right path.

794
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:28,055
direction..

795
01:32:38,404 --> 01:32:40,214
as you say god.

796
01:32:43,699 --> 01:32:45,715
have you heard of rathong glacier?

797
01:32:46,255 --> 01:32:46,826
no

798
01:32:48,096 --> 01:32:52,684
Its in himalaya, catch the train and go
to siliguri.

799
01:32:52,826 --> 01:32:57,969
..from there in bus to gangtok..
from there..

800
01:32:58,191 --> 01:33:01,270
by foot. it would take 8 days.

801
01:33:01,858 --> 01:33:06,239
In kanchenjunga mountain there is a
huge god's temple.

802
01:33:07,509 --> 01:33:08,445
go there.

803
01:33:09,303 --> 01:33:11,017
your job will be done.

804
01:33:11,128 --> 01:33:13,477
its a wrong number.

805
01:33:13,557 --> 01:33:14,271
what it is?

806
01:33:14,271 --> 01:33:15,461
wrong number.

807
01:33:15,668 --> 01:33:21,049
tapasvi ji. the technology you are using to reach
god is fused.

808
01:33:21,588 --> 01:33:23,795
all calls are reaching to wrong number.

809
01:33:24,207 --> 01:33:27,993
..and there is a duplicate god sitting there
who is duping you.

810
01:33:28,041 --> 01:33:31,501
what..what are you trying to say?

811
01:33:31,613 --> 01:33:34,422
i'll explain.
we all are god's child right?

812
01:33:35,152 --> 01:33:36,041
yes. so?

813
01:33:36,295 --> 01:33:39,914
..so if your child comes to you with his problem.
what would you do?

814
01:33:40,469 --> 01:33:41,819
solve his problem. yes?

815
01:33:42,025 --> 01:33:46,869
or would you say..
2000 km. away i have one more house.

816
01:33:46,869 --> 01:33:50,009
visit me there and explain me the same
problem once again.

817
01:33:50,056 --> 01:33:52,294
then i will resolve. how illogical.

818
01:33:53,256 --> 01:33:58,151
if call would have reached the right god,
he must have said take care of her.

819
01:33:58,421 --> 01:34:00,754
why left her and chasing me?

820
01:34:00,961 --> 01:34:06,257
once you will die, we will meet.
atleast now spend time with her.

821
01:34:06,818 --> 01:34:08,009
right?

822
01:34:12,183 --> 01:34:17,009
i can prove. someone is duping here.
call the god again.

823
01:34:17,135 --> 01:34:21,796
do you give guarantee that aunty will
be fine?

824
01:34:21,913 --> 01:34:25,231
uncle, get written confirmation first.
don't leave aunty without it.

825
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:28,072
call now. everything will be clarified.

826
01:34:29,582 --> 01:34:32,851
its time for tapasvi ji's silence meditation.

827
01:34:47,383 --> 01:34:51,383
that duplicate god told you that
my thing is yours.

828
01:34:55,637 --> 01:34:57,700
its not god, but fraud.

829
01:34:58,605 --> 01:35:01,684
its fraud.

830
01:35:01,811 --> 01:35:05,319
till now nobody has seen or heard about god.

831
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:09,256
what god wants, his managers tell us.

832
01:35:09,811 --> 01:35:12,065
Pk raised an important question today.
what?

833
01:35:14,335 --> 01:35:17,970
Do god really hear his managers.

834
01:35:18,033 --> 01:35:18,541
no

835
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:23,208
the solutions is created by god or any fraud.

836
01:35:23,381 --> 01:35:24,859
coming from wrong number.

837
01:35:24,889 --> 01:35:27,460
so pk what should public do?

838
01:35:27,492 --> 01:35:32,429
till the telephone problem fixed.
talk to each other and resolve problems.

839
01:35:32,651 --> 01:35:33,905
help each other.

840
01:35:34,286 --> 01:35:35,381
pk has a point.

841
01:35:35,921 --> 01:35:40,461
we should boycott these managers.

842
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:44,476
instead support each other. just like...

843
01:35:51,886 --> 01:35:56,236
pk says this temple should not be build because
that object is his.

844
01:35:56,252 --> 01:35:57,442
what's in your pocket?

845
01:36:00,632 --> 01:36:01,982
you smoke?

846
01:36:02,982 --> 01:36:03,712
yes

847
01:36:03,934 --> 01:36:05,458
and alcohol too.right?

848
01:36:07,045 --> 01:36:08,013
occasionally.

849
01:36:08,299 --> 01:36:14,886
you drink and smoke after knowing that it kills.

850
01:36:15,902 --> 01:36:17,775
government gives permit.

851
01:36:18,712 --> 01:36:24,633
factory makes this poison.
its sold opening in shops.

852
01:36:24,633 --> 01:36:26,960
..yet nobody objects.

853
01:36:27,008 --> 01:36:40,339
when in this holy ground we want to construct
a temple then why objections?

854
01:36:40,595 --> 01:36:48,895
if you want to ask question, ask PK.

855
01:36:50,038 --> 01:36:52,260
is he muslim?

856
01:36:53,133 --> 01:36:55,552
or some anti hindu religion?

857
01:36:56,101 --> 01:37:04,181
you must ask PK these questions.
and about his religion.

858
01:37:11,734 --> 01:37:14,353
mehmood gajni came many years ago.

859
01:37:15,544 --> 01:37:22,909
..to destroy temples.
today once again somebody came.

860
01:37:51,687 --> 01:37:53,369
can you call your god?

861
01:37:53,861 --> 01:37:58,639
he wants to know my religion right?
first ask him what religion do their these
kids have.

862
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:00,687
is it a joke?

863
01:38:00,703 --> 01:38:03,052
call me and ask.

864
01:38:03,163 --> 01:38:07,004
its easy even i can answer.

865
01:38:07,353 --> 01:38:14,528
he's christian, he's sikh, he's jain and
she's from your cast.

866
01:38:16,066 --> 01:38:19,146
could you reveal now?

867
01:38:19,258 --> 01:38:23,264
hello, i am sikh.

868
01:38:23,391 --> 01:38:25,925
i am muslim.

869
01:38:24,407 --> 01:38:26,732


870
01:38:26,464 --> 01:38:28,068
i am jain.

871
01:38:28,052 --> 01:38:30,575
i am christian.

872
01:38:31,195 --> 01:38:35,249
and i am jagat janani. sikh.

873
01:38:35,592 --> 01:38:40,401
confused?
i changed their cloths randomly.

874
01:38:41,116 --> 01:38:43,671
religion connection is with fashion.

875
01:38:43,862 --> 01:38:46,401
let me show you.

876
01:38:46,703 --> 01:38:49,783
beard and moustache means
sikh.

877
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:52,734
take out turban so hindu.

878
01:38:52,846 --> 01:38:56,545
if exclude moustache
then muslim.

879
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,005
This difference is made by wrong numbered
god.

880
01:39:00,053 --> 01:39:04,275
had it been real god. he would have put
his stamp on your body.
do you have any?

881
01:39:04,338 --> 01:39:05,021
mine?

882
01:39:05,037 --> 01:39:08,735
what are you gazing? take off your
cloths and check.

883
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:11,037
why shy?

884
01:39:11,196 --> 01:39:16,611
come on all for tapasvi ji.. take off cloths and
check your body for stamp.

885
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,371
why shy? ok i do first.

886
01:39:23,323 --> 01:39:24,244
watch.

887
01:39:27,121 --> 01:39:31,642
do you see any religious stamp?

888
01:39:32,343 --> 01:39:36,168
do you see? wait let me take off...

889
01:39:36,232 --> 01:39:37,676
security.

890
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:43,470
what are you doing?
let me prove.

891
01:39:48,358 --> 01:39:50,501
that's not god's object.

892
01:39:59,056 --> 01:39:59,818
jaggu.

893
01:40:01,215 --> 01:40:02,659
finish this.

894
01:40:06,342 --> 01:40:10,246
you were 40 days old when tapasvi gave
you your name.

895
01:40:10,675 --> 01:40:14,723
keep in mind he can give name,
then ruin your name too.

896
01:40:15,072 --> 01:40:18,901
papa, he gave me the most ruined name.
jagat janani.

897
01:40:19,107 --> 01:40:22,742
you. how much money you want?

898
01:40:23,313 --> 01:40:26,202
-papa
-you're harassing tapasvi ji for money?

899
01:40:26,566 --> 01:40:27,139
no.

900
01:40:27,298 --> 01:40:32,325
you will burn in hell.
have some fear from god.

901
01:40:38,171 --> 01:40:41,377
thank you..papa. thank you.

902
01:40:41,441 --> 01:40:44,822
i had incomplete knowledge.
Now i know everything.

903
01:40:44,838 --> 01:40:52,439
this whole game is about fear.
wrong number god is not just duping but
taking advantage of our fear.

904
01:40:52,806 --> 01:40:55,552
whatever you know. could you
explain papa?

905
01:40:55,616 --> 01:41:00,276
ofcourse. come.

906
01:41:00,758 --> 01:41:03,155
i don't have time for this non-sense.

907
01:41:03,489 --> 01:41:07,949
papa. deal. if it'll turn out to be non-sense.
i will shut the show.

908
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:24,008
papa, this college has exams.
all students are terrified.

909
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:28,336
now we'll start here business from fear.
- come i will show.

910
01:41:40,196 --> 01:41:42,434
here's the machine in factory.

911
01:41:47,656 --> 01:41:50,008
some investment.

912
01:41:54,275 --> 01:41:58,615
here's the inauguration.

913
01:42:07,075 --> 01:42:08,091
now watch.

914
01:42:08,615 --> 01:42:11,619
in 15 minutes investment is double.

915
01:42:18,438 --> 01:42:19,899
there you go.

916
01:42:21,406 --> 01:42:23,073
this is how it begins.

917
01:42:23,645 --> 01:42:25,978
tea.. hot tea.

918
01:42:26,041 --> 01:42:30,485
look in tea business there is
more investment.

919
01:42:30,501 --> 01:42:34,009
bicycle, cup, sugar, tea-pot, gas etc.

920
01:42:34,009 --> 01:42:37,866
and here..a stone and red color.

921
01:42:38,024 --> 01:42:39,216
tea..tea..hot tea.

922
01:42:39,484 --> 01:42:41,854
there you need to call customers.

923
01:42:41,977 --> 01:42:45,180
and here you have to blow them away.

924
01:42:46,196 --> 01:42:49,790
move, give others chance too.

925
01:42:51,755 --> 01:42:54,540
there you need to bow to customers.

926
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:57,865
here customers bow to you.

927
01:42:59,945 --> 01:43:04,151
look,
if someone is really scared he'll lay down completely

928
01:43:04,421 --> 01:43:09,298
wrong number god is doing business.
business of fear.

929
01:43:09,468 --> 01:43:12,989
he knows, the one who scares
goes to temple.

930
01:43:13,071 --> 01:43:16,293
you are also very coward.
take this all off.

931
01:43:17,833 --> 01:43:20,214
don't stand against religion.

932
01:43:20,309 --> 01:43:21,627
its about faith.

933
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:29,599
if god wanted that we don't raise
questions then he wouldn't give us common sense.

934
01:43:29,742 --> 01:43:33,892
these religious businessmen when can't answer,
gets violent.

935
01:43:33,933 --> 01:43:37,836
scares us and surpress us.
but now we won't be quiet.

936
01:43:38,171 --> 01:43:42,497
now more pk will arise.

937
01:43:44,699 --> 01:43:53,540
friends, if you see anyone dialing wrong number,
make their video and send us. we'll broadcast it on tv.

938
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,398
ask questions, spread awareness

939
01:44:08,283 --> 01:44:15,585
one question, if you can emerge gold out of no where,
when why don't you help poor?

940
01:44:18,606 --> 01:44:23,761
when you can emerge gold by yourself,
then why ask donation from us?

941
01:44:29,127 --> 01:44:31,826
its a wrong number.

942
01:44:32,016 --> 01:44:39,662
- jaggu come with me.
- wait
- just come with me right now.

943
01:44:39,778 --> 01:44:45,583
you guys are on fire. whole world is sending
wrong number videos.

944
01:44:49,837 --> 01:45:01,625
they said feed cow and you'll get job.
is this cow will upload my resume on job websites?
its a wrong number.

945
01:45:01,955 --> 01:45:02,399
more

946
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:09,018
he said become christan otherwise god will send you to hell.
if god wanted he would have made me born in christain family.

947
01:45:09,034 --> 01:45:12,848
now why making me change religion.
wrong number.

948
01:45:13,256 --> 01:45:15,129
they all want to go to school.

949
01:45:15,288 --> 01:45:18,855
now there is a fatwa, if girls go to school,
kill them.

950
01:45:18,923 --> 01:45:23,609
god can't be so mean that he has problem
with their future.

951
01:45:23,875 --> 01:45:25,050
its wrong number.

952
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:29,240
whatever is in our destiny,
will happen.

953
01:45:30,288 --> 01:45:34,494
god has made only one masterplan for
whole universe.

954
01:45:34,494 --> 01:45:37,082
you must accept that.

955
01:45:37,113 --> 01:45:41,542
outside temple your followers are selling your
holy books in very cheap price.

956
01:45:41,542 --> 01:45:46,233
here if you read this 4 lines, you will have
a new born son.

957
01:45:46,304 --> 01:45:53,076
it means get a 10 rupee book, read 4 lines and screw up
the whole nature cycle.

958
01:46:01,862 --> 01:46:06,338
pk, your show is hit.
whole word is texting.

959
01:46:07,363 --> 01:46:08,640
here, one more.

960
01:46:12,751 --> 01:46:13,878
what happend?

961
01:46:15,068 --> 01:46:19,161
dad sent message,
he is ashamed of me.

962
01:46:22,664 --> 01:46:31,765
i was very little when i wrote my first
 poem for dad.

963
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:39,169
i look like mother, says everyone.
its true.

964
01:46:39,169 --> 01:46:42,369
but i am the daughter of my daddy.

965
01:46:42,607 --> 01:46:44,529
i narrated this poem in annual day.

966
01:46:45,495 --> 01:46:47,290
every parents in the crowd, applaud.

967
01:46:47,909 --> 01:46:51,940
amongst those clapping, my dad was whistling
nonstop.

968
01:46:52,972 --> 01:46:57,130
clapping stopped, but whistling didn't.

969
01:46:58,305 --> 01:47:01,401
he was so proud of me.

970
01:47:03,782 --> 01:47:07,893
and today he wrote he is ashamed of me.

971
01:47:08,687 --> 01:47:14,542
he has some kind of illusion.

972
01:47:14,576 --> 01:47:21,048
the day he'll have clean mindset, he'll whistle
non stop yet again.

973
01:47:21,195 --> 01:47:22,608
that day will never come.

974
01:47:22,989 --> 01:47:29,893
knock it off, come.
i will show you what one does when
 in sorrow in my planet.

975
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:33,454
here follow me.

976
01:47:33,517 --> 01:47:37,597
just copy me to get your battery recharged.

977
01:47:42,337 --> 01:47:44,994
..and what are you doing exactly?

978
01:47:51,519 --> 01:47:54,567
close your eyes.
-then how will i copy you?

979
01:47:54,678 --> 01:47:56,075
point. let it open then.

980
01:49:30,533 --> 01:49:43,577
mi lukin e sina. mi awen e sina.
mi pali ala e ijo ante li awen lon monsi sina.
==gazing you, bearing you,
i forgotton everything and just follow you.

981
01:49:43,596 --> 01:49:49,724
ni li weka tenpo a.
olin li weka tenpo.
==this is such a waste of time,
love is a waste of time.

982
01:49:56,279 --> 01:50:09,089
ni la tenpo wan pi lon mi anu tenpo mute la 
mi weka e tenpo mi. olin li weka tenpo.
==then also i decided atleast once in this life,
i will waste my time. love is a waste of time.

983
01:50:32,436 --> 01:50:43,378
tenpo mute la mi lukin e mi. tenpo mute la mi pona e linja mi.
==many time i see mirror and do my hair.

984
01:50:43,759 --> 01:50:55,759
tenpo mute la mi ante e len mi. tenpo mute la mi telo pi kon pona e mi.
==may time i changed my cloths and put deodrant.

985
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:16,941
mi pilin e ijo nasa lon pilin mi.
mi ken ala toki e sona ona.
==weird and unexplained feeling in my heart.
not sure how to describe.

986
01:52:19,228 --> 01:52:36,252
mi jo e sinpin pi pilin pona tan ala.
mi sona ala e ijo lon ni.
mi pilin sama ni: mi tawa sewi li pana e kalama wawa.
==I smile without reason,
not sure what is going on.
feel like flying and shouting.

987
01:53:40,777 --> 01:53:43,314
donation box has more questions than
money guru.

988
01:53:43,472 --> 01:53:49,869
all your products have stopped selling.

989
01:53:49,996 --> 01:53:53,551
facebook and twitter is full
of negative comments.

990
01:53:54,821 --> 01:53:56,974
only five?

991
01:53:56,974 --> 01:54:02,418
these are positive.
rest bulk is with profanity.

992
01:54:02,456 --> 01:54:07,562
do something,
we can't stay hidden long time.

993
01:54:15,004 --> 01:54:21,414
call him.
now its our turn to ask questions.

994
01:54:25,094 --> 01:54:27,983
tapasvi wants to come to our show.

make pk ready.

996

don't forget to watch,
one more question at 6 pm.

997
01:54:44,776 --> 01:54:50,068
my friend has become star.

998
01:54:50,242 --> 01:54:53,242
he stays naked in public.

999
01:54:54,433 --> 01:54:56,528
i made him star.

1000
01:54:56,814 --> 01:55:09,697
jackass is sitting in tv.
and me here in this filthy place, in a
smutty bar, drinking disgusting alcohol with a dumbass like you.

1001
01:55:10,830 --> 01:55:12,766
made him star. bullshit!

1002
01:55:29,607 --> 01:55:32,162
pk bhairosingh called, asking
for you.

1003
01:55:36,416 --> 01:55:36,988
brother.

1004
01:55:37,146 --> 01:55:40,956
licentious boy. you have become a star.

1005
01:55:41,321 --> 01:55:43,591
brother, where are you?

1006
01:55:43,654 --> 01:55:50,543
Now i am mandava,
but i am coming tomorrow along with a gift for you.

1007
01:55:50,654 --> 01:55:54,559
The theif who stole your thing is in my abduction.

1008
01:55:54,876 --> 01:55:57,717
he sold your stuff for 40000 rupees.

1009
01:55:57,797 --> 01:56:03,119
ask to who.
-to who
-to tapasvi ji.

1010
01:56:07,701 --> 01:56:11,051
god said its a broken piece of lord shiva's drum.

1011
01:56:13,242 --> 01:56:20,718
god said take it and situate it in a grand new
holy temple because its presence..

1012
01:56:22,691 --> 01:56:24,337
hello, what happened?

1013
01:56:25,353 --> 01:56:28,369
the thief who stole my remote is caught.

1014
01:56:31,130 --> 01:56:36,686
brother said, theif sold it to tapasvi ji.

1015
01:56:36,749 --> 01:56:38,726
then tapasvi is in trouble.

1016
01:56:38,924 --> 01:56:45,465
lets take thief to tapasvi ji, and ask him
to return remote otherwise we will reveal the truth
by theif on television.

1017
01:56:45,956 --> 01:56:49,019
tapasvi ji didn't find my remote in himalaya.

1018
01:56:49,114 --> 01:56:51,353
that means he is lying.

1019
01:56:54,177 --> 01:56:59,080
that means wrong number is spread by
tapasvi ji not duplicate god

1020
01:57:01,479 --> 01:57:03,955
did you know about that?

1021
01:57:04,177 --> 01:57:07,701
pk, remember the first time you
talked about wrong number?

1022
01:57:07,701 --> 01:57:12,717
whoever is trying to reach god, tapasvi ji
is dialing wrong number for them.

1023
01:57:12,717 --> 01:57:15,834
i knew in a second that you were
not doing it right.

1024
01:57:15,834 --> 01:57:21,231
but i didn't clear your confusion.
because if you call tapasvi ji fraud
his follower would've beaten you.

1025
01:57:21,231 --> 01:57:23,707
people needed an creative
solution.

1026
01:57:23,707 --> 01:57:25,342
hold on. that's wrong number.

1027
01:57:25,342 --> 01:57:28,183
and your examples with wrong number
really pulled mass attention.

1028
01:57:28,342 --> 01:57:30,834
today they are all supporting you.
- its a wrong number.

waste her time with me.

1039
01:58:22,284 --> 01:58:24,268

why don't you suggest me some name.
whichever you like.

1047
01:58:51,762 --> 01:58:58,065
you see name and personality should match.

1048
01:58:58,112 --> 01:59:03,063

1049

one terrorist group was resposible for this attack

1072
02:03:45,933 --> 02:03:51,930
..they said it was only an example.
nobody can mess up with our religion.

give me ..

1080
02:05:05,225 --> 02:05:06,109
what is this?

1081
02:05:07,427 --> 02:05:12,328
what is this, god says this is his.

1082
02:05:12,407 --> 02:05:16,120
but he says it's his property.

1083
02:05:16,911 --> 02:05:24,623
God says contruct temple,
but he obstructs.

1084
02:05:24,859 --> 02:05:29,810
now who shall we follow?
GOD or him?

1085
02:05:30,276 --> 02:05:33,949
he was wearing yellow helmet 
and distributing this..

1086

have a look

1087
02:05:36,796 --> 02:05:43,225
first he stated God is missing,
later called him fraud.

1088
02:05:43,403 --> 02:05:46,419
tomorrow he might say
god is dead.

1089
02:05:48,086 --> 02:05:49,951
son, what are you upto?

1090
02:05:50,903 --> 02:05:54,177
..a world where god doesn't exist?

1091
02:05:56,384 --> 02:06:01,027
Do you have a clue about common people's
pain.

1092
02:06:01,205 --> 02:06:02,906
..there is no food to eat

1093
02:06:03,705 --> 02:06:06,146
no house to live.

1094
02:06:06,959 --> 02:06:13,709
no friends to talk..
many commit suicide everyday

1095
02:06:14,142 --> 02:06:17,203
cut their wrist,
hang themselves on ceiling.

1096
02:06:17,416 --> 02:06:20,915
..because they don't have hope.

1097
02:06:21,708 --> 02:06:23,466
if worshing god..

1098
02:06:24,843 --> 02:06:32,559
..following customs and praying gives them hope

1099
02:06:32,559 --> 02:06:36,343
then who are you to take
their hope away?

1100
02:06:37,097 --> 02:06:37,970
and if..

1101
02:06:38,744 --> 02:06:45,850
..you really want to detach people from god,
then tell us what would you give us in return?

1102
02:06:46,434 --> 02:06:49,569
enough of these "wrong number" allegations.

1103
02:06:50,780 --> 02:06:55,995
instead tell us today what exactly is the
right number.

1104
02:07:04,607 --> 02:07:07,067
you are right

1105
02:07:08,258 --> 02:07:13,179
once even i didn't have food to eat..

1106
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:15,778
no place to live

1107
02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:18,258
i used to cry a lot

1108
02:07:19,329 --> 02:07:22,026
..as i didn't have any friends
either.

1109
02:07:23,515 --> 02:07:26,094
that time i only had one support

1110
02:07:28,614 --> 02:07:30,003
..God.

1111
02:07:31,610 --> 02:07:37,404
every morning felt like tomorrow
will be less worse, god will do something.

1112
02:07:39,797 --> 02:07:40,297
i agree..

1113
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:47,339
that believing in god gives hope.

1114
02:07:48,150 --> 02:07:52,309
..gets strength to cope with pain.

1115
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:57,379
but i have a question.

1116
02:07:58,638 --> 02:08:00,463
which god to trust?

1117
02:08:02,547 --> 02:08:05,067
you say god is one.

1118
02:08:07,090 --> 02:08:07,974
i say wrong..

1119
02:08:09,701 --> 02:08:10,994
there are two gods.

1120
02:08:12,657 --> 02:08:14,304
one who created us

1121
02:08:16,745 --> 02:08:19,542
..and second whom you created.

1122
02:08:21,585 --> 02:08:24,642
i don't know anything about the one
who created us.

1123
02:08:25,098 --> 02:08:26,804
but the one you created..

1124
02:08:27,062 --> 02:08:30,304
is exactly like you.

1125
02:08:30,369 --> 02:08:34,555
small, liar, corrupted, makes false
promises.

1126
02:08:34,932 --> 02:08:38,960
he meets rich quickly,
and makes poor wait in queue.

1127
02:08:39,139 --> 02:08:41,044
gets happy when appreciated.

1128
02:08:41,143 --> 02:08:43,456
frighten people over small things.

1129
02:08:44,607 --> 02:08:46,472
I have a simple point.

1130
02:08:48,437 --> 02:08:53,080
trust god who created us.

1131
02:08:54,806 --> 02:08:59,659
and strike out the fake god you created.

1132
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,873
and you think we'll stay quiet?

1133
02:09:08,191 --> 02:09:11,980
Son, we know how to protect our god.

1134
02:09:12,020 --> 02:09:13,449
you will protect god?

1135
02:09:15,495 --> 02:09:15,995
..you?

1136
02:09:16,763 --> 02:09:18,260
this planet very small

1137
02:09:18,946 --> 02:09:22,143
million bigger planets are out there in
space.

1138
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:29,003
and you are sitting in that small planet,
in small city, in small room, talks about protecting god?

1139
02:09:29,144 --> 02:09:31,593
the one who created this whole life?

1140
02:09:31,803 --> 02:09:33,980
he doesn't need your protection.

1141
02:09:34,878 --> 02:09:37,123
he can protect himself real good.

1142
02:09:39,766 --> 02:09:45,824
today somebody tried to protect their god 
and my friend died.

1143
02:09:46,432 --> 02:09:48,635
only this shoe is left.

1144
02:09:50,420 --> 02:09:56,134
stop protecting the god, or else in
this planet only shoes will be left, no humans.

1145
02:09:56,591 --> 02:09:58,156
one muslim blows a bomb

1146
02:09:59,242 --> 02:10:03,990
and one hindu guru is listening your lecture.

1147
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:04,940
nice.

1148
02:10:05,472 --> 02:10:11,020
where is the stamp to prove that you
are hindu and i am muslim?

1149
02:10:11,861 --> 02:10:14,446
this difference is created by mankind.

1150
02:10:14,849 --> 02:10:20,841
and that itself is the most dangerous wrong number
of this planet.

1151
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:24,472
due to this people die.

just once, 
for my sake.

1185
02:12:44,604 --> 02:12:49,306
I was waiting and a letter arrived.

1186
02:12:49,624 --> 02:12:51,733
did sarfaraz himself delivered?

1187
02:12:53,671 --> 02:12:54,564
no

1188
02:12:56,820 --> 02:12:58,744
he sent through a kid.

1189
02:12:58,784 --> 02:13:00,351
did it have any name on it?

1190
02:13:00,391 --> 02:13:01,264
noooo.

1191
02:13:01,304 --> 02:13:04,566
then how did you know it was sarfarz's
letter?

1192
02:13:07,653 --> 02:13:11,997
it could've been for some other woman.

1193

place didn't have another woman?

1194
02:13:17,347 --> 02:13:20,467
there was one with a cat.

02:13:21,554 --> 02:13:25,805
and she gave you cat to carry.

1196
02:13:26,951 --> 02:13:30,627
kid who delieved letter,
did he know you?

no

1200
02:13:34,867 --> 02:13:38,717
then how would he know that
he should give letter to you.

1201
02:13:40,038 --> 02:13:46,451
perhaps he's been told to deliver letter
to woman with cat.

1202
02:13:48,212 --> 02:13:52,134
he gave you letter. you read..

1203
02:13:52,319 --> 02:13:54,768
and didn't even call sarfaraz later?

1204
02:13:55,726 --> 02:13:57,331
did you call him?

1205
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:02,926
no. because tapasvi ji struck wrong
number in your brain.

02:24:50,419 --> 02:24:52,007
and my father.

1311
02:24:55,459 --> 02:25:00,399
i will gaze at his star till i am 
alive.

1312
02:25:01,255 --> 02:25:02,384
and wave.

1313
02:25:04,765 --> 02:25:08,118
i am sure he'll do the same.

1314
02:25:12,860 --> 02:25:13,932
i miss him.

1315
02:25:48,749 --> 02:25:50,218
one year later..

1316
02:25:54,583 --> 02:25:58,194
brothers in an hour we'll land
on earth.

1317
02:25:58,563 --> 02:26:01,103
don't forget what i taught you.

1318
02:26:01,361 --> 02:26:03,464
only four major points.

1319
02:26:03,603 --> 02:26:06,559
1. its prohibited to walk naked there.

1320
02:26:06,639 --> 02:26:11,611
this kissing stuff and naked tasks are
being performed unseen,
 behind four walls.

1321
02:26:11,691 --> 02:26:16,384
thing which is allowed in public are
fight, war and cussing etc.

1322
02:26:16,552 --> 02:26:19,964
2. biggest confusion here is language.

1323
02:26:20,043 --> 02:26:24,687
if you hear in market that i'd like
 chicken/fish.

1324
02:26:24,746 --> 02:26:27,933
that doesn't mean they love animals.

1325
02:26:27,992 --> 02:26:32,397
it means they'll eat them for lunch today.

1326
02:26:32,476 --> 02:26:37,813
we will research why there is a difference
 in what they speak and think.

1327
02:26:37,952 --> 02:26:41,631
3. we'll steal cloths from the dancing car
right after landing.

1328
02:26:41,694 --> 02:26:44,789
then please insert your remote in your
underwear.

1329
02:26:44,849 --> 02:26:49,099
..really really deep inside.
don't want anyone to steal.

1330
02:26:49,234 --> 02:26:57,066
and 4. most importantly if you meet someone
who says he can help you contacting God.

1331
02:26:57,150 --> 02:27:03,427
..then to hell with research. just take a U-turn
and run for your life in full speed.

1332
02:27:14,657 --> 02:27:16,834
come bro, don't be scared. come.

1333
02:27:20,799 --> 02:27:24,014
what for you gazing? eh?

1334
02:27:25,105 --> 02:27:26,653
I have a question.

1335
02:27:27,227 --> 02:27:28,061
what?

1336
02:27:28,696 --> 02:27:34,089
last time how many times you
got beaten up?

1337
02:27:41,537 --> 02:27:42,708
what's that for?

1338
02:27:42,748 --> 02:27:43,978
self defense.

1339
02:27:45,220 --> 02:27:46,708
aha, safety!

1340
02:27:46,946 --> 02:27:48,579
let's go
-yes let's go.

1341
02:27:48,692 --> 02:27:51,628
not that direction.
this direction...

1342
02:27:51,740 --> 02:27:54,121
