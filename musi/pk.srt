00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,084
mun lon sewi li mute, a.
==There are so may stars in the sky

2
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,791
tenpo wan la sina lukin nanpa e ona?
==Have you ever tried to count it?

3
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:54,744
sina kama nanpa e ona, la sina wile awen lon sike suno pi mute ike.
==If you will start counting today then it will take 6000 years to

4
00:01:54,807 --> 00:01:57,545
mute mun ni pi taso ala li jo e mun pi mute ike.
==finish counting stars in only our galaxy

5
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:02,358
sin la mute mun ante li mute.
==and there a lot of such galaxies

6
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:05,445
Scientist says that perhaps 2 billons more.

7
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,994
So isn't it possible that out of so many galaxies there is one planet out there

8
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:15,049
people like us exist.

9
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,735
Just like we are traveling to moon and mars in order to reach them

10
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:21,679
There could be a possibilty

11
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:24,543
They are also trying to reach us in order to spot our existence.

12
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:26,167
Song playing in a radio

13
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,504
The thing which thief has stolen was the remote control

14
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:18,465
that is being used to relocate the space ship.

15
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:21,650
Without the remote control he can't go back to his home

16
00:06:22,473 --> 00:06:24,169
Neither he knew our language

17
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:26,679
Nor he had any friends here

18
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:27,810
alone

19
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:29,229
and frightened

20
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:33,430
he was thinking only one thing that how he'll return home now.

21
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:46,667
Sorry but i raised my hand first

22
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:49,001

23
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:51,747

24
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:54,874
but i am also a big fan of Amitabh bacchan

25
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:04,828
I started reading his poems when i was 10.

26
00:07:58,475 --> 00:08:01,069
I started practising his dialogues when i was 5

27
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,062

28

30
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:09,332

36
00:08:31,263 --> 00:08:35,930
Before interval you can listen to your poems, and after that i can listen to amitabh's acting.

69
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:13,954

your favorite poet is harivansh rai bacchan.

71

79
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,907
jagat jannani

80
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:39,463
everybody used to mock me at school

81
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,669
therefore i made it short

82
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:41,383
jaggu

83
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:43,975

00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:54,039
here itself in pakistan embassy.

91
00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:56,277
in pakistan embassy. why?

92
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,565

93
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,315
Indian embassy wouldn't hire me afterall.

94
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:06,283

98
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:23,760
khuda hafiz (good bye in urdu)

99
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:50,943
Lets put our identity and tradition aside

100
00:12:52,828 --> 00:13:04,348
..and just walk together side by side.

101
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:21,431
Lets put our identity and tradition aside

102
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:29,356
..and just walk together side by side.

103
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:29,179
i'll give you shadow in the harsh sun light

104
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:37,711
if the darkness will scare you in farther sky,
i will decorate a moon for you

105
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:45,125
if the sadness will surround you
i would tell you jokes and make you laugh

106
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:53,505
we'll keep smiling and walking few steps
hand in hand.

107
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:12,756


108
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:20,413
the world doesn't scare me anymore after i met you.

109
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:27,854
Not just few steps i could walk with you my whole life.

110
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:26,405
Thank you

111
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:29,527
mummy

112
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,172
papa..she's fallen in love

113
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:35,109
fallen in love?

114
00:16:35,717 --> 00:16:36,643
he's so cute.

115
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:38,469

116
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:41,167

117
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:43,998

118
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:45,453
first tell us his name.

119
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:47,675
sarfaraz.

120
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:49,897
he is muslim?

121
00:16:50,982 --> 00:16:54,951
yes papa. he is studying architure here.
but family is in pakistan.

122
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:55,823
pakistan?

123
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,442
what are you saying? you are going to wear burka? read namaz?
 you have gone insane

124
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:06,702
jaggu you stay right there, don't disconnect.
take out my car..quickly.

125
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:09,956
its been a disaster, please help us guruji.

126
00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:12,363
I knew where my father was going.

127
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:16,543
Since childhood we saw face of tapasvi guru ji face
 more than our parents.

128
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:24,187
from school bag to bather wall he was present everywhere.

129
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:31,012
he wouldn't even go to dentist without taking a auspicious advise from guruji.

130
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:38,631
tapasvi ji presented my dad a box in which there was a
favorable god for each and every task.

131
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:44,002
when he was doing share trading he used
to show laxmi godess sculpture to the computer screen.

132
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,255
and when he was on treadmill
there was a hanuman ji sculpture.

133
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:55,046
Internet prayer, auspicious sight, prasad via courier.
it was all tapasvi ji's idea.

134
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:11,845
jaggu touch his feet and take his blessings

135
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:24,871
why jagat janani? why you want to do suicide?

136
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:27,976
grab a pen and a paper and write.

137
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:32,579
God...show me the way.

138
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,934
as you wish.

139
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:48,008
write the future prediction jagat janani.

140
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:54,754
The guy from pakistan named sarfaraz will deceive you.

141
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:56,765
No he won't

142
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:05,563
if you look at the past they have never been honest

143
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:11,912
he will use your body but never going to marry you.
infact he will leave you soon.

144
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:16,251
jaggu, come back to India right away.
If you will stay one more night there..

145
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:17,732
you will no longer be my daughter.

146
00:19:18,182 --> 00:19:20,748
Mr. sahni, let me speak with her

147
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:24,822
child, just press the delete button..

148
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:27,340
and disconnect him out of your life.

149
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:36,573
what's going on?

150
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:39,721
do you love me?

151
00:19:40,938 --> 00:19:42,314
ofcourse i do. why?

152
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,615
Will you marry me?

153
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:46,467
but what happend?

154
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:47,181
just yes or no?

155
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:49,117
yes but..

156
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:49,779
tomorrow.

157
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:50,546
tomorrow?

158
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:54,038
tomorrow we will get married.

159
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:56,922
Tapasvi ji's prediction is false.

160
00:19:57,874 --> 00:19:58,694
I'll prove it.

161
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:06,075
Congratulation.

162
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:37,810
It was sarfaraz's letter.

163

he wrote that marriage happend between two families.

164
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:45,461
Our country, people and religion everything is different.

165

We can not be happy by making our family unhappy.

166
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:24,375
I was in my city,

167
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:26,306
I joined a news channel.

168
00:21:26,888 --> 00:21:30,619

Why are you distributing these brochures?

175
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:29,150
One of my case is pending with God.

176
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:31,589
Neither he resolved nor be found.

177

Why are you wearing this helmet?

183
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:11,387
I learned from taxi, even in heavy traffic
 it can be spotted from long distance because of flashy yellow color.

184
00:23:11,678 --> 00:23:12,393
so?

185
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:18,107
So it will be easy for the God also to spot me in heavy crowd.

186
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:37,027
They say that animals don't suicide.

who lives in ramesh nagar in delhi.

189
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:51,709
It tried jumping from the terrace, licking a sleeping pills
and jumping on a gas burner.

190
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:53,905
Why did nikku do this?

191
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:57,106
Is nikku suffering from a mental disorder?

 distributing pamphlets. seaching God.

00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:52,203
Did he found?

No..but..

207
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:58,657
Seaching God is religion, Finding God is news.

208
00:24:59,293 --> 00:25:02,256
When he found the God bring him here i will put him on air.

209
00:25:02,388 --> 00:25:02,943
but

210
00:25:03,076 --> 00:25:06,938
you know the company policy.
No news on religion and no news on god.Finish.

..when i broadcasted the news against him.

216
00:25:31,837 --> 00:25:36,706
That day i decided if i want to stay in this country
i should avoid messing up with religion. That's it.

217
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:48,464
boss didn't let me follow up that story.

218
00:25:49,218 --> 00:25:52,797

00:27:19,863 --> 00:27:22,753
I was putting money in donation box but my purse fell in it.

227
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:25,126
He was just helping me to take it out.

I was taking back my refund.

237
00:28:01,478 --> 00:28:03,311
He took the payment but didn't do my job.

I saw first you took out some money
 and then put it back?

240
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:13,635
In this office department (temple) i only deposited 200 rupees.

244
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:24,345
Self-defense.

00:28:25,476 --> 00:28:29,682
Just like they put god picture on wall
so that nobody urinate on it.

246
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,421
I put it here so that nobody hit me.

260
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:21,262
Money can't help me.

261
00:29:21,976 --> 00:29:23,762
Why? where do you live?

Its not a college canteen where you can
go in and have a refreshment. its a lock up.

279
00:31:44,324 --> 00:31:47,221
Only people who do crime can go in. understand?

280
00:31:48,928 --> 00:31:52,301

291
00:32:51,698 --> 00:32:52,769

293
00:33:00,658 --> 00:33:04,865
astronaut? people who go to moon?

294
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:08,396
I have been there once. its absolutely dull place.

295
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:13,833
ok, so what's your favorite planet?

296
00:33:14,071 --> 00:33:15,222

297
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,484
thats for sure but apart from earth?

298
00:33:17,722 --> 00:33:21,134
Earth is banged up. i said my own planet.

299
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:29,349
when its night its visible up there.

300
00:33:30,103 --> 00:33:38,158
..we had a huge fuzz that day when
we found there is similar planet like ours exist.
where people like us live.

301
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:45,452
they sent me here to do research, but
shockingly somebody stole my spaceship's remote control.

302
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:49,976
Without it i can't send signal home.

303
00:33:50,134 --> 00:33:54,102
and if i won't send signal nobody will come here to
take me back.

304
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:58,746
They'll think its a dangerous planet and i died here.

305
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:07,754
listen, open the gate i want to go home.

306
00:34:07,991 --> 00:34:12,189
leave that up to us.

307
00:34:12,348 --> 00:34:13,618
i am not a thief.

308
00:34:13,737 --> 00:34:15,562
yes, all thief say the same thing.

309
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,547
where is pandey ji. call him.

310
00:34:17,745 --> 00:34:18,856
he's not here.

311
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,237
pandey ji.

312
00:34:22,785 --> 00:34:27,785
pandey ji!
hey girl, keep quiet or else..

313
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:48,420
you think my story is nonsense?

314
00:34:49,523 --> 00:34:53,571
yes, your planet language can't be bhojpuri.

315
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:55,475
our ball doesn't even..

316
00:34:56,626 --> 00:35:02,301
our ball doesn't even have any language.
we talk with mind. no room for confusion.

317
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,475
here they say something and mean something else.

318
00:35:05,554 --> 00:35:07,420
one statement has four meanings.

319
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:12,658
shake your head like this and
 say its good..very good. means all is well.

320
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:17,856
make the eyes bigger and say "accha" it means
someone is in shock.

321
00:35:17,936 --> 00:35:20,991
"your mother had an accident".
"accha"? - Shock

322
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:27,380
when one gets angry, voice becomes loud.
"accha"? "you are teaching me"?

323
00:35:28,285 --> 00:35:31,539
and once someone thinks. there is a long "accha."

324
00:35:31,856 --> 00:35:34,158
"acchaaa"

325
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:44,872
With words you need to learn the expressions as well.
it was so damn confusing. took me 6 hours to learn bhojpuri.

326
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,721
you mean in 6 hours you learned complete
 bhojpuri?

327
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,934
Nobody was letting me hold their hand.
but then i found a lady who co-operated with me.

328
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:57,848
I hold her hand and transffered the whole language
to me.

329
00:35:57,966 --> 00:36:01,697
hey you just can't stop blabbering.
put some limit to your lie.

330
00:36:02,403 --> 00:36:08,672
Is your hand a USB cable that you can transfer
file like one computer to another? huh?

331
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:12,720
and what about your cloths? People in your planet
also wear branded jeans?

332
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:18,950
No No..in our ball nobody wears cloths.

333
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:27,601
At first when i came here i thought people here
have different skin.

334
00:36:28,117 --> 00:36:32,918
some have shining skin, some have black.

335
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,830
some colorful and some absolutely white.

336
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,879
some skin were tacky, some loose.

337
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:48,704
then one day i found a car..dancing car.

338
00:36:54,776 --> 00:36:59,736
That day i realized people here have similar skin like us.

339
00:37:00,649 --> 00:37:06,808
They just put some objects known as fashion
 around their body.

340
00:37:13,546 --> 00:37:16,832
Now i could also meet with people
 from your planet ball.

341
00:37:17,189 --> 00:37:20,800
but not sure why everyone was laughing at me.

342
00:37:26,276 --> 00:37:31,475
took a little time to understand that male and female
 had separate fashion.

343
00:37:31,712 --> 00:37:34,847
Morning and night fashion was different.

344
00:37:35,205 --> 00:37:38,856
Playing sports and having toast fashion was different.

345
00:37:41,276 --> 00:37:45,562
With cloths i also found a picture.

346
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:03,163
I slowly realized that this photo is very important
in order to survive on this ball.

347
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:11,546
In exchange to this photo, food to eat can be earned.
hence i started collecting photos of this famous personality.

348
00:38:25,901 --> 00:38:27,013
what?

349
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:34,394
why you giving me this?

350
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:39,036
why you giving junk in my shop?

351
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:47,362
aha, give me that. there you go, carrots.

352
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,164
then i got this feeling that the value of this photo
is only on one kind of paper.

353
00:38:52,521 --> 00:38:56,569
on other papers the value is zero.

354
00:38:58,473 --> 00:39:06,677
then gradually i managed to get cloths from dancing car.

355
00:39:07,124 --> 00:39:13,655
once i found such a wonderful attire that i
didn't even need the paper with photo to get food.

356
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:17,124
food came flying to me irresistibly.

357
00:39:19,504 --> 00:39:23,830
Now inorder to get my remote back i needed to learn
 this ball's language.

358
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,036
without language nothing was possible here.

359
00:39:27,353 --> 00:39:32,988
for example telling this gentleman that i think
 his fashion may have some defect.

360
00:39:39,496 --> 00:39:42,512
I felt i messed up his fashion.

361
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,401
that's why i recorrected.

362
00:40:17,684 --> 00:40:22,089
I found him on road, some jerk hit and ran.

363
00:40:22,883 --> 00:40:28,517
seems alright but he doesn't response.

364
00:40:29,033 --> 00:40:31,890
perhaps he's gone deaf?

365
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:36,573
hey deaf!
he does hear but not answering.

366
00:40:38,597 --> 00:40:44,500
i think he had a shock, and now memory loss.

367
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:58,765
do you remember who hit you?

368
00:40:59,677 --> 00:41:05,153
do you remember the vehicle's number or
anything at all?

369
00:41:34,238 --> 00:41:39,667
come with me.

370
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:44,471
you are my guest until your memory comes back.

371
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:54,342
keep banging your head, if a hit can take memory away
 it can return the same way too.

372
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:55,626
I saw it in films.

373
00:41:55,786 --> 00:42:02,807
In order to understand what he was saying i needed
to grab his hand and transfer the language.

374
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:11,183
woah! Memory lost and you forgot the difference between
male and female?

375
00:42:11,443 --> 00:42:21,720
one second, have a look at my license.
sex - male, man, mister, jerk, bastard..

376
00:42:22,396 --> 00:42:27,496
inorder to go back home, holding someone's hand
 was a priority now.

377
00:42:43,586 --> 00:42:47,090
here comes our jaunty guest.

378
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:54,070
who doesn't differentiate male or female.

379
00:43:10,784 --> 00:43:27,966
licentious boy visited us as a guest.

380
00:46:36,142 --> 00:46:41,063
i can understand your pain, but don't hold anyone's
hand here in public.

381
00:46:41,459 --> 00:46:47,357
I know sometimes luck can favor,
but your life could get in danger.

382
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:54,792
don't be sad, ok come with me.

383
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:11,671
here you can hold anybody's hand or leg,
nobody is going to assault you.

384
00:47:12,601 --> 00:47:17,563
This place was a paradise, everyone was very beautiful
and friendly..

385
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:26,174
everybody wanted to hold my hand and take me to their home.
then i met a very gentle and calm minded lady
 named phuljhariya.

386
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,658
phuljhariya, take him to the honeymoon suite.

387
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:26,426
she showed tremendous patience, and I
till 6 hours kept transffering the language.

388
00:48:26,544 --> 00:48:32,511
1, 2, 3, XYZ everything inside her i pulled everything.

389
00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:43,930
first time?

390
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,850
your bulb fused before even started. eh?

391
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,287
yea..

392
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,168
where do you live?

393
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,623
I came from far away miss.

394
00:49:04,922 --> 00:49:08,136
you might not have even heard about
my village.

395
00:49:08,295 --> 00:49:10,557
your language is just like mine though.

396
00:49:11,111 --> 00:49:16,231
i learned from you sister that's why.

397
00:49:16,778 --> 00:49:19,754
hey.. sister? mind your language.

398
00:49:19,992 --> 00:49:20,786
get lost!

399
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:30,079
brother! wake up brother!

400
00:49:31,341 --> 00:49:33,439
you started talking!

401
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,905
I need your help brother.

402
00:49:35,984 --> 00:49:38,167
what magic phuljhariya did on you?

403
00:49:38,405 --> 00:49:40,222
come with me quickly

404
00:49:40,348 --> 00:49:43,325
Apparently there is a direct connection
between memory and sex.

405
00:49:43,444 --> 00:49:48,722
We have to tell this to the doctor.
The most delighted operation of pleasure.

406
00:49:48,841 --> 00:49:52,809
There is a very important thing.. please
come with me. hurry up.

407
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,646
stop..stop!

408
00:50:04,456 --> 00:50:09,683
brother, that culprit snatched my necklace chain
right at this spot.

409
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,948
I need that chain brother.

410
00:50:13,027 --> 00:50:14,178
Is it expensive?

411
00:50:14,297 --> 00:50:15,869
Very expensive.

412
00:50:16,003 --> 00:50:25,210
its highly possible that thief is from our village.
but as anyone can get caught easily here he
must have tried to sell it in delhi

413
00:50:25,527 --> 00:50:28,156
So i have to go brother.

414
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:28,900
where?

415
00:50:30,249 --> 00:50:31,480
Delhi.

416
00:50:56,242 --> 00:51:00,012
Mister.
yes?
My remote control has been stolen.

417
00:51:00,172 --> 00:51:04,497
Are you PK (drunk)?
Police have no other work to do then
finding people's tv remote?

418
00:51:04,616 --> 00:51:05,767
It wasn't tv remote.

419
00:51:05,926 --> 00:51:06,719
then?

420
00:51:08,267 --> 00:51:13,027
that i can't tell. but it was a very
expensive necklace.

421
00:51:13,386 --> 00:51:14,815
Where it was stolen?

422
00:51:15,093 --> 00:51:16,918
in mandava. Rajasthan.

423
00:51:17,156 --> 00:51:21,045
Idiot ! It was stolen in mandava and you are
finding it in delhi?

424
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:23,934
yes but that theif came to delhi.

425
00:51:24,053 --> 00:51:24,450
so?

426
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:25,719
he'll be found here.

427
00:51:25,831 --> 00:51:31,466
chucklehead! the population of this city is 1.5 crore.
Police is also human not God.

428
00:51:35,275 --> 00:51:38,051
Now only God can help you.

429
00:51:39,877 --> 00:51:43,549
Praise the God only he can show you
 the right way.

430
00:51:45,593 --> 00:51:48,735
Only God knows where to find it.

431
00:51:50,196 --> 00:51:52,856
Only God would know..Now get lost.

432
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:58,581
Have faith in God son.

433
00:51:58,966 --> 00:52:04,193
Who is this God who can help me.
everyone is blabbering its name.

434
00:52:04,514 --> 00:52:12,252
What is saw blew my mind.
The people of this ball knew who manufactured there planet.

435
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:17,330
Infact he(God) was living with them only.
In every street he had his house.

436
00:52:17,528 --> 00:52:23,878
Million of people go to his house with small
fee and he takes away all their trouble.

437
00:52:23,998 --> 00:52:27,133
Such magic and miracle is not in my planet.

438
00:52:27,688 --> 00:52:32,172
I couldn't believe. I thought of giving
it a try.

439
00:52:34,672 --> 00:52:36,339
Could you give me a god?

440
00:52:36,498 --> 00:52:40,506
Which one? 20 one? 50 one? 100 one or 500 rupee one?

441
00:52:40,538 --> 00:52:43,871
what is the difference in 20 one and 500 rupee one?

442
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:46,600
Only size difference. rest is same.

443
00:52:46,687 --> 00:52:50,134
So the 20 rupee one works just fine as well. right?

444
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:54,268
here, give 15 rupees. just take and go.

445
00:53:07,204 --> 00:53:11,559
God i am starving.
Let me get something to eat.

446
00:53:23,104 --> 00:53:27,975
I went totally nut. this God seemed to be
working.

447
00:53:28,103 --> 00:53:30,088
Now i could go back my home.

448
00:53:30,285 --> 00:53:36,189
God my remote control is stolen.
Could you get that to me. i want to go home.

449
00:53:49,293 --> 00:53:54,412
This God's battery went down or what?
It worked for a while and then choked.

450
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:55,286
What do you mean?

451
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:57,270
I mean put in a new battery.

452
00:53:57,508 --> 00:53:59,532
Hey it doesn't work with battery.

453
00:53:59,651 --> 00:54:02,580
Then why it doesn't work.
it's a Manufacturing defect?

454
00:54:02,738 --> 00:54:04,564
We don't make defecting  piece.

455
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,421
you made this god?

456
00:54:07,738 --> 00:54:10,397
Yes. With my own hands.

457
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:14,127
you made God or God made you?

458
00:54:14,524 --> 00:54:19,591
God has made us all. We have just made
their sculpture.

459
00:54:19,802 --> 00:54:21,746
Why do you make their sculpture?

460
00:54:21,865 --> 00:54:25,651
So that we can pray and
could talk to them about troubles.

461
00:54:26,111 --> 00:54:30,685
Does it have some sort of transmitter.
How the messages reach to him?

462
00:54:30,992 --> 00:54:35,913
God doesn't need a transmitter. He
hear us all directly.

463
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:39,461
If he hear directly then what is the need
of these sculptures?

464
00:54:39,603 --> 00:54:41,508
Oh man what to do with him?

465
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:45,040
you want to close my shop?

466
00:54:45,665 --> 00:54:47,413
What is your problem anyway?

467
00:54:47,532 --> 00:54:53,047
My remote control is stolen i am asking God
but he is not telling me anything.

468
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:54,595
dude. you (PK) drunk?

469
00:54:54,674 --> 00:54:56,103
what you mean?

470
00:54:56,301 --> 00:55:02,413
hey how much overload you'll give to this little god?
How he is going to run and chase the theif with
such little feet?

471
00:55:02,611 --> 00:55:08,286
Get inside the temple there is a bigger God.
He'll run faster and do your job quickly.

472
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:12,984
Give this coconut and some money and he'll do the job.
now give me 200 rupees.

473
00:55:18,603 --> 00:55:22,722
Everyone was waiting with a coconut and money
inorder to get their work done.

474
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:25,976
After 2 hours my turn came.

475
00:55:26,174 --> 00:55:31,889
God..God please get me my remote.

476
00:55:34,905 --> 00:55:36,095
where is it?

477
00:55:36,373 --> 00:55:37,603
come on. Move.

478
00:55:37,762 --> 00:55:40,024
but i didn't get what i wanted.

479
00:55:40,182 --> 00:55:44,389
Hey mister. He is not doing my work,
I even deposited the fee.

480
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:45,222
Will be done.

481
00:55:45,222 --> 00:55:45,778
When?

482
00:55:45,936 --> 00:55:48,793
How can i tell you that.
It will be done. have patience.

483
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:50,024
Give me the way. Move.

484
00:55:50,102 --> 00:55:52,008
But when will i get my thing?

485
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:53,873
Don't block the line. Move futher.

486
00:55:54,032 --> 00:55:56,770
But what if God will give my stuff
to someone else?

487
00:55:56,492 --> 00:55:57,485
you pk (drunk)?

488
00:55:57,523 --> 00:56:00,659
madam, just hang on. what are you doing?
but where will i get my stuff?

489
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:02,000
In mental hospital.

490
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:06,206
How is that possible. I gave the cash here
and delivery in mental hospital?

491
00:56:06,285 --> 00:56:07,674
Get him out of here.

492
00:56:07,673 --> 00:56:09,301
Atleast give me the receipt.

493
00:56:09,777 --> 00:56:13,822
give me the receipt.
If someone will ask at Mental hospital
what will i show as a proof?

494
00:56:13,944 --> 00:56:17,343
Get off.
-but my remote?

495
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:28,705
I can't find my chappal (mule)

496
00:56:29,182 --> 00:56:35,095
Someone might have taken it.
you take someone else's.
In temples such rotation is common.

497
00:56:48,883 --> 00:56:53,210
They took the payment but
didn't do my job.

498
00:56:57,137 --> 00:56:58,169
his name?

499
00:56:58,764 --> 00:56:59,518
Bhagwan (God)

500
00:56:59,637 --> 00:57:00,590
Full name?

501
00:57:01,145 --> 00:57:03,090
i don't know the full name.

502
00:57:04,161 --> 00:57:05,550
where does he live?

503
00:57:06,344 --> 00:57:07,931
In the near by temple.

504
00:57:08,407 --> 00:57:10,391
you gave money in his hands?

505
00:57:10,747 --> 00:57:12,098
No. I put in his box.

506
00:57:12,336 --> 00:57:13,923
Did he say he is going to do your job?

507
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:15,113
That's the problem.
He doesn't talk.

508
00:57:15,192 --> 00:57:16,939
why? is he dumb?

509
00:57:17,255 --> 00:57:19,921
Maybe he is.

510
00:57:21,978 --> 00:57:23,645
Tell me his appearance.

511
00:57:26,899 --> 00:57:28,645
exactly like this.

512
00:57:30,913 --> 00:57:33,373
Only bigger in size.

513
00:57:34,723 --> 00:57:37,311
come here.

514
00:57:37,897 --> 00:57:39,723
Are you PK (drunk)?

515
00:57:39,842 --> 00:57:42,778
Yes. but how does everyone know?

516
00:57:42,858 --> 00:57:44,246
Are we all stupid?

517
00:57:44,762 --> 00:57:50,239
I am working 20 years as a police.
takes me a second to know whoever is drunk.

518
00:57:50,556 --> 00:57:54,140
Kripal singh.
Search him.

519
00:57:54,921 --> 00:58:01,112
See what's in it.
-Dr. Demello.

520
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:06,063
Doctor, Why do you drink so much
that you even forget your religion?

521
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:10,731
Instead of church you went inside
temple? do you want a riot?

522
00:58:10,992 --> 00:58:15,270
you should go to your church,
to your own God.

523
00:58:17,413 --> 00:58:18,484
church?

524
00:59:08,623 --> 00:59:10,250
but my stuff?

525
00:59:11,162 --> 00:59:16,043
because of your sin, the god is being crucified, and you...

526
00:59:16,202 --> 00:59:20,408
crucified when?

527
00:59:20,567 --> 00:59:24,252
2000 years ago. for your sins.

528
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:28,026
but what did i do?
I just came here.

529
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,783
you PK (drunk)?

530
00:59:30,782 --> 00:59:31,242
yes.

531
00:59:31,242 --> 00:59:34,653
God is watching your behavior.

532
00:59:34,773 --> 00:59:37,829
Where..where is the god?

533
00:59:38,297 --> 00:59:40,202
What is in that vessel?

534
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,233
wine.

535
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:52,860
Wine.
Now i understood God became bored with coconut water,
now he started enjoying wine and it was expensive.

536
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,995
 so i started gathering money.

537
00:59:56,313 --> 00:59:59,878
Some money i got from that dancing car.

538
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:11,153
..and some from that generous man standing
on the bridge so that people can take as much as they want.

539
01:00:28,562 --> 01:00:30,752
bhaaisaab, Is there around a
house of God somewhere?

540
01:00:30,776 --> 01:00:32,054
yes its right in front.

541
01:00:54,698 --> 01:00:55,975
wait.
what's in it?

542
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:59,055
Wine.
For god.
Where is he?

543
01:01:39,944 --> 01:01:45,947
One madam seemed very sad.
inorder to know the reason i held her hand.

544
01:01:46,293 --> 01:01:48,674
Jerk! Trying on a widow?

545
01:01:49,071 --> 01:01:51,372
how do you know she is widow?

546
01:01:51,372 --> 01:01:54,468
you don't see white saree?

547
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:16,281
So sad that your husband died.

548
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:17,563
what when?

549
01:02:17,563 --> 01:02:20,690
how am i supposed to know.
you are the one wearing white.

550
01:02:20,769 --> 01:02:23,388
In marriage everyone wears white.

551
01:02:23,388 --> 01:02:25,293
no white is when someone dies.

552
01:02:25,452 --> 01:02:29,732
black dress is when someone dies.
Stupid. Get lost.

553
01:02:39,738 --> 01:02:43,547
what a co-incidence. All your 3 husbands
died at the same time?

554
01:02:43,547 --> 01:02:45,103
hey i am still alive.

555
01:02:46,223 --> 01:02:51,700
After lots of punches and kicks i realized that
there isn't a single God in this planet but instead many.

556
01:02:52,044 --> 01:02:54,478
Any every God has its own rules.

557
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:59,637
Every God has opened their own company.
People were calling it religion.

558
01:02:59,953 --> 01:03:02,812
There was a different manager for each religion.

559
01:03:03,605 --> 01:03:08,499
Every man in this planet was attached to one religion/company.

560
01:03:08,981 --> 01:03:13,901
and that person was strictly following that one manager of
the company only.

561
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:18,399
Now which company's member am i?
which God should i pray?

562
01:03:18,531 --> 01:03:22,504
In order to get my remote knowing this was
very important.

563
01:03:37,508 --> 01:03:38,917
What are you doing?

564
01:03:39,129 --> 01:03:40,504
Where is the hallmark seal?

565
01:03:41,139 --> 01:03:42,621
Which hallmark seal?

566
01:03:43,362 --> 01:03:44,631
The religious seal?

567
01:03:45,716 --> 01:03:48,740
Which company this child belong to..
How would one find that?

568
01:03:49,048 --> 01:03:50,981
Where does god put his stamp?

569
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,080
finding my religion
was turing out to be impossible.

570
01:04:04,529 --> 01:04:09,477
Now there was only one way..
to start praying Gods of all the religion.

571
01:04:09,529 --> 01:04:13,061
One of them must be my God.
Who'd listen to me.

572
01:08:43,238 --> 01:08:45,196
There is a big confusion god.

573
01:08:48,227 --> 01:08:52,248
I am making some mistake for sure
that you can't hear me.

574
01:08:54,568 --> 01:08:55,878
ask my trouble

575
01:08:57,505 --> 01:08:59,240
Atleast guide me.

576
01:08:59,806 --> 01:09:00,719
please

577
01:09:04,568 --> 01:09:11,421
Should i hold my hands or
should i bow my head on your feet?

578
01:09:14,448 --> 01:09:19,522
Should i ring a bell or
use a loudspeaker to wake you up?

579
01:09:20,203 --> 01:09:24,540
Should i follow geeta, kuran or bible?

580
01:09:25,917 --> 01:09:29,492
Every one of your manager says
something different

581
01:09:30,592 --> 01:09:35,124
Some asks to fast on monday and some tuesday.

582
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:40,737
some says to eat before sunrise, some after sunset.

583
01:09:41,107 --> 01:09:45,427
some says to pray cow, some says to sacrfice it.

584
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:50,323
Some says to wear boots in your house,
 some says don't.

585
01:09:51,901 --> 01:09:56,292
I can't understand who to follow.

586
01:09:58,972 --> 01:10:00,862
it has become frustrating, God.

587
01:10:04,091 --> 01:10:08,568
I just want to go home.
I'll do whatever you say.

588
01:10:09,323 --> 01:10:11,784
Just let me go home. please.

589
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:16,355
Say something

590
01:10:17,498 --> 01:10:24,006
somebody amongst you, answer me please.

591
01:10:25,514 --> 01:10:26,863
please.

592
01:10:29,522 --> 01:10:30,514
please.

593
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:41,208
hey why you locking?

594
01:11:41,254 --> 01:11:42,445
i won't let you go today.

595
01:11:42,842 --> 01:11:45,104
open the door, i have an entry.

596
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:49,224
Shiv, who is the sin destroyer.
not afraid of anything.

597
01:11:49,223 --> 01:11:51,215
gone. who are you?

598
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:55,967
didn't recognise me?
I am PK.

599
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:03,762
Security. anybody there?
-Drunk person is here. Shall i do skit in the toilet?

600
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,877
Open the door..now

601
01:12:07,877 --> 01:12:09,468
first get me my remote.

602
01:12:09,548 --> 01:12:11,118
which remote?

603
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:12,604
Spaceship's.

604
01:12:13,437 --> 01:12:14,191
spaceship?

605
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:18,190
Forgotton? I told you so many times.

606
01:12:18,477 --> 01:12:22,290
I am not from this planet,
came from far away.

607
01:12:22,953 --> 01:12:26,564
Just get me my remote and i'll go home.

608
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,937
brother let me go,
I have small children.

609
01:12:30,374 --> 01:12:31,302
i know it very well.

610
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:34,477
Ganesh and kartik. They aren't little and can survive alone.

611
01:12:34,477 --> 01:12:38,955
you get me my remote and then
go to your family.

612
01:12:39,239 --> 01:12:40,906
Oh god save me.

613
01:12:40,985 --> 01:12:43,289
there is a God above you?

614
01:12:43,289 --> 01:12:44,455
Om namah shivaya

615
01:12:44,636 --> 01:12:45,971
where is he?

616
01:12:51,699 --> 01:12:53,309
Save me!

617
01:13:02,255 --> 01:13:07,151
Somebody help!

618
01:13:52,096 --> 01:13:58,755
I was in the himalaya..meditating

619
01:13:59,191 --> 01:14:11,298
..then suddenly i see light,
from this small object on the ground.

620
01:14:11,493 --> 01:14:19,236
I closed my eyes thought about God,
and i got enlighted.

621
01:14:19,509 --> 01:14:27,952
this object was so hot even in
a very cold weather.

622
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:35,795
God confirmed its the broken piece of
lord shiva's pellet drum. embrace it.

623
01:14:36,017 --> 01:14:48,306
take it and put it in a temple. its auspicious
sight will take people's trouble away.

624
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:57,459
would you like to see it?

625
01:15:00,108 --> 01:15:04,242
praise the lord shiva.

626
01:15:17,759 --> 01:15:23,156
Lord shiva, miracle!

627
01:15:23,156 --> 01:15:24,267
stop.

628
01:15:24,267 --> 01:15:28,571
Let him come, he's excited.

629
01:15:28,711 --> 01:15:31,489
Lord Shiva, Greetings

630
01:15:31,489 --> 01:15:33,711
not there, here

631
01:15:33,949 --> 01:15:36,383
Say what you want to say here.

632
01:15:36,383 --> 01:15:42,630
Shiva is great.
-Shiva is great.

633
01:15:42,759 --> 01:15:46,967
Lord where are you hiding?
come upfront, accept my gratitude.

634
01:15:47,759 --> 01:15:54,342
He's right here.
found him in the toilet.
when i asked for my property, he ran.

635
01:15:54,584 --> 01:16:03,182
I thought he escaped but he brought me here
to my property.
praise the lord!

636
01:16:03,791 --> 01:16:09,861
Its not shiva's. its mine.
Might have been a cross delivery.

637
01:16:10,219 --> 01:16:16,096
yours must be lost.
Ask the lord. he is here.
come in front lord.

638
01:16:16,648 --> 01:16:20,525
Its ok i will take my property.

639
01:17:31,846 --> 01:17:36,593
Since when you feel you don't
belong here?

640
01:17:39,386 --> 01:17:45,716
you should meet a psychiatrist.

641
01:17:45,973 --> 01:17:50,021
Madam time to go. the punishment worth
500 rupees is over.

642
01:17:50,021 --> 01:17:51,205
one moment.

643
01:17:57,751 --> 01:18:07,022
here's my card. I could get you
meet a psychiatrist. call me.

644
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:18,780
you think my story is fake?

645
01:18:21,323 --> 01:18:28,362
so go on telecast nikku dog story
on tv. you aren't lucky enough.

646
01:18:36,164 --> 01:18:39,585
pandey ji. I want to meet him once
more.

647
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:49,030
Instead give me 500 rupee more
and take the whole man.

648
01:18:49,259 --> 01:18:52,311
i don't remember telling you about
suicidal dog.

649
01:18:52,354 --> 01:18:53,920
because you didn't.

650
01:18:54,259 --> 01:18:56,209
how did you know?

651
01:18:57,310 --> 01:19:02,299
I read your mind when you held my hand.

652
01:19:02,354 --> 01:19:06,481
you thought my story is bogus,
you have to manage with nikku dog now.

653
01:19:06,481 --> 01:19:09,418
don't lie. i must have told you.

654
01:19:09,577 --> 01:19:16,182
people in my planet touch hands and read minds.
here people use false words.

655
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:18,736
here let me show you.

656
01:19:18,735 --> 01:19:19,212
No way.

657
01:19:19,529 --> 01:19:28,180
Help me son. My wife is sick in the hospital.
they need 10000 rupees.
I am short with 500 rupees.

658
01:19:28,498 --> 01:19:33,184
If you will give 500 rupees..
-I'll give.

659
01:19:34,133 --> 01:19:38,402
There you go.
-Write me your address
i will return.

660
01:19:38,402 --> 01:19:41,672
its impossible to send money
where i live. you keep it.

661
01:19:41,672 --> 01:19:43,981
Thank you son.

662
01:19:44,133 --> 01:19:48,515
Uncle! keep 100 rupee more
for the tip.

663
01:19:49,642 --> 01:19:53,167
long live son.

664
01:19:53,498 --> 01:20:03,898
its proved now that you were lying.
he made you fool. there is no hospital
nearby.

665
01:20:03,898 --> 01:20:08,420
I know. he brought his wife for
treat to a 5 star hotel.

666
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:13,314
Today his wife's 75th birthday.
She's never been to 5 star hotel.

667
01:20:13,314 --> 01:20:19,026
gradually he was collecting money from
his pension. wife ordred an extra ice cream.

668
01:20:19,026 --> 01:20:22,783
he went out of money. he gave bathroom as
an excuse and came here.

669
01:20:22,783 --> 01:20:24,584
what a crap.

670
01:20:24,926 --> 01:20:31,093
in our ball nobody lies.
believe it or not.

671
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:41,030
Its your birthday after all.
Enjoy.

672
01:22:37,216 --> 01:22:39,857
Told you nobody lies in my
planet.

673
01:22:42,295 --> 01:22:44,041
did you tell anybody?

674
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:53,803
you didn't tell anyone that you
are alien. right?

675
01:22:53,803 --> 01:23:01,263
No No. if i had they would caged me
in a laboratory for experiment.

676
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:04,791
then why trusted me?

677
01:23:06,263 --> 01:23:15,466
Since the day i came here,
everybody took money from me.
you were the first one put money for me in the donation box.

678
01:23:15,549 --> 01:23:19,651
I got a feeling that you are gentleman.
can be trusted.

679
01:23:22,327 --> 01:23:24,311
I'll get you your remote.

680
01:23:25,819 --> 01:23:27,009
how?

681
01:23:28,041 --> 01:23:33,835
how i don't know.
but you will go back home for sure.
i promise.

682
01:24:21,454 --> 01:24:22,815
what for you gazing?

683
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:28,060
aliens don't visit me often
after all.

684
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:34,978
Do everyone in your planet has
such weird ear?

685
01:24:36,088 --> 01:24:37,120
yes

686
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:42,358
and everyone stay naked?
don't you find weird?

687
01:24:43,152 --> 01:24:50,472
that crow is sitting naked. looks weird to you?
it be weird if will wear a tie.

688
01:24:52,517 --> 01:24:59,820
PK i kept thinking whole night
how to get back your remote from tapasvi.

689
01:25:00,215 --> 01:25:04,025
-hello!
-hello, connect me to balbir singh room no. 4.

690
01:25:04,025 --> 01:25:06,695
wrong number.

691
01:25:06,723 --> 01:25:10,930
-its not fortis hospital?
-I have been telling you since yesterday
its a wrong number.

692
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:15,295
-how could it be wrong number.
I myself saved it in the mobile phone.

693
01:25:16,009 --> 01:25:18,580
so what did you think?

694
01:25:21,723 --> 01:25:25,007
hello connect to balbir singh, room no. 4

695
01:25:25,007 --> 01:25:30,295
you called so late, he died this morning.

696
01:25:30,453 --> 01:25:31,653
what?

697
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,086
but how could someone die in
haemorrhoids operation?

698
01:25:35,086 --> 01:25:42,621
yeah that's strange. but ok we will write in
death certificate it was heart attack.
family reputation should not be spoiled.

699
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:47,051
-come take the body.
-yes yes..umm on my...
-BYE.

700
01:25:49,501 --> 01:25:50,771
why you said that?

701
01:25:51,009 --> 01:25:57,185
spreading happiness.
He will have a good surprise once he'll see
his friend alive.

702
01:25:58,151 --> 01:26:02,433
I fed up with his wrong numbers.
so just duped him.

703
01:26:02,739 --> 01:26:03,358
duped?

704
01:26:04,104 --> 01:26:05,866
PK i was just kidding.

705
01:26:15,116 --> 01:26:17,434
I understood now the whole case.

706
01:26:17,655 --> 01:26:18,847
Someone is duping.

707
01:26:19,147 --> 01:26:24,385
whoever dials God's number for trouble via tapasvi
never reaches God cuz he is duping everyone.

708
01:26:25,242 --> 01:26:27,567
Tapasvi ji is a fraud here.
who dials wrong number.

709
01:26:28,163 --> 01:26:30,877
and someone sitting above is duping people.
who is not a God.

710
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:34,978
otherwise why would God call my remote
their property?

711
01:26:36,671 --> 01:26:37,814
I feel..

712
01:26:38,528 --> 01:26:43,433
..the communication system between God and people
in this planet is completely wrenched.

713
01:26:43,496 --> 01:26:46,820
that's why all managers ( gurus) call is going
to a wrong number.

714
01:26:46,972 --> 01:26:47,544
meaning?

715
01:26:47,544 --> 01:26:51,639
that's why god was giving me illogical
solutions to my problems.

716
01:26:52,543 --> 01:26:57,189
Sometimes he say come to my house rolling
on the road then i will do your work.

717
01:26:57,189 --> 01:26:58,909
now tell me aren't we god's children?

718
01:26:59,401 --> 01:27:04,515
so normal parents would never tell their
kids to do such horrible things.

719
01:27:04,948 --> 01:27:10,349
your father ever told you if you
need a new dress you should roll on
the floor?

720
01:27:10,727 --> 01:27:14,997
sometimes says shower me with cow's milk
everyday. how illogical.

721
01:27:15,346 --> 01:27:20,315
Pk..if these cals would have reached the right number..

722
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:22,108
..then what would he say?

723
01:27:22,424 --> 01:27:28,706
he would have said give milk and food to the
poor people.

724
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:31,600
..why on earth you showering me with milk?

725
01:27:31,648 --> 01:27:34,965
I am sure someone is duping people like
you did on phone.

726
01:27:35,346 --> 01:27:40,029
Pk thought tapasvi was honest.
but i didn't say a word.

727
01:27:40,457 --> 01:27:43,124
i had an idea..

728
01:27:43,394 --> 01:27:45,886
an idea that would get PK's remote.

729
01:27:48,267 --> 01:27:49,409
who is this PK?

730
01:27:49,917 --> 01:27:51,457
his identity is unknown.

731
01:27:52,173 --> 01:27:54,347
but he has a unique imagination.

732
01:27:55,284 --> 01:27:56,506
mean?
- it means that..

733
01:27:57,205 --> 01:28:01,062
if he'll spot you smoking
he'll call police saying you are doing suicide.

734
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:04,633
because packet states "smoking kills"

735
01:28:06,982 --> 01:28:07,903
what is the point?

736
01:28:10,649 --> 01:28:15,094
War.
I want to collide tapasvi ji with PK on tv.

737
01:28:15,601 --> 01:28:17,792
it will be a one on one debate.

738
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:23,975
jaggu..
i already have marks on my right butt.

739
01:28:25,229 --> 01:28:27,784
do you want it to be balanced out
on the left butt too?

740
01:28:28,197 --> 01:28:32,800
No.
the highlight of this debate will be
that PK will not fight with tapasvi.

741
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:38,276
Pk will just explain nicely that their
prayers are going to a wrong number.

742
01:28:38,276 --> 01:28:40,901
tapasvi will have no idea how to
answer him.

743
01:28:41,689 --> 01:28:45,848
cherry..cherry..
he is here. just meet him once.

744
01:28:46,562 --> 01:28:50,641
I challenge you, even you
can't take away his confusions.
trust me. please.

745
01:29:01,832 --> 01:29:04,050
it fell from your pocket.

746
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,832
its not mine.

747
01:29:11,975 --> 01:29:14,118
kamasutra, strawberry flavor.

748
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:17,737
I hate strawberries man.

749
01:29:18,165 --> 01:29:21,594
ask someone else. its not mine.
what a weirdo.

750
01:29:24,467 --> 01:29:26,165
is it yours?
-How dare you?

751
01:29:26,911 --> 01:29:30,038
- check your purse maybe something i missing.
- dickhead.

752
01:29:31,673 --> 01:29:35,673
- uncle is it yours?
- No not mine.

753
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:40,530
Pk. that's his.
whatever you want to ask, ask him.

754
01:29:42,716 --> 01:29:43,494
come.

755
01:29:45,748 --> 01:29:46,605
what's this?

756
01:29:48,272 --> 01:29:49,399
its condom.

757
01:29:50,066 --> 01:29:51,082
what's it use?

758
01:29:51,399 --> 01:29:53,510
it controls world population.

759
01:29:55,462 --> 01:29:56,097
how?

760
01:29:57,050 --> 01:29:58,336
by  putting it on.

761
01:29:59,815 --> 01:30:01,196
..while having sex.

762
01:30:03,878 --> 01:30:06,847
how  is it controlled
if you'd put it?

763
01:30:07,116 --> 01:30:10,148
Not if i put it on.
millions of people wear it.

764
01:30:10,529 --> 01:30:12,434
do you give this everyone?

765
01:30:12,926 --> 01:30:14,148
everyone got it.

766
01:30:14,814 --> 01:30:15,847
I have a question.

767
01:30:16,084 --> 01:30:17,830
please go ahead PK.

768
01:30:18,957 --> 01:30:23,052
When money is dropped,
everyone claims its mine.

769
01:30:23,211 --> 01:30:27,989
..but when condom drops,
everyone denies. why so?

770
01:30:29,148 --> 01:30:31,544
buddy sex is a very private subject.

771
01:30:31,894 --> 01:30:32,640
why?

772
01:30:32,798 --> 01:30:35,735
nobody announces the world that today
i am having sex.

773
01:30:36,385 --> 01:30:45,639
then why in marriages..everyone announces the
whole town with firecrackers & loud speakers..
that today i will have sex.

774
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:50,741
what happened?

775
01:30:50,963 --> 01:30:52,915
I dont have a reply to that.

776
01:30:53,296 --> 01:30:55,360
..but i do have a job for you.

777
01:30:58,661 --> 01:31:01,566
lets leave before he changes his mind.

778
01:31:04,978 --> 01:31:09,264
you better hide your butt now tapasvi,
because my trishul (weapon) has launched.

779
01:31:14,518 --> 01:31:18,930
Pk..tapasvi ji meets everyday with their follower
here. and pass their messages to God.

780
01:31:19,343 --> 01:31:22,312
we'll go in and listen to their phone calls.

781
01:31:22,534 --> 01:31:28,915
the moment you feel the calls are reaching
wrong number, you start explaining
tapasvi ji.

782
01:31:29,248 --> 01:31:31,201
then he'll return my remote?

783
01:31:31,248 --> 01:31:38,455
the day he'll understand someone is duping,
and that object is not god's.
he should return it.

784
01:31:40,024 --> 01:31:41,151
ok i will explain.

785
01:31:42,961 --> 01:31:49,358
to make someone's house is virtue.
and to make god's house is the greatest virtue.

786
01:31:50,374 --> 01:31:52,247
donate in abundance.

787
01:31:53,247 --> 01:31:55,643
and get rid of all your troubles.

788
01:31:56,564 --> 01:31:58,977
say it devotee. what bothers you?

789
01:32:01,469 --> 01:32:05,358
tapasvi ji..my wife is paralysed since 6 months..

790
01:32:06,279 --> 01:32:08,231
doctors can't help her..

791
01:32:08,644 --> 01:32:10,374
i want that you..

792
01:32:10,395 --> 01:32:10,895


793
01:32:11,581 --> 01:32:15,041
God, show him the right path.

794
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:28,055
direction..

795
01:32:38,404 --> 01:32:40,214
as you say god.

796
01:32:43,699 --> 01:32:45,715
have you heard of rathong glacier?

797
01:32:46,255 --> 01:32:46,826
no

798
01:32:48,096 --> 01:32:52,684
Its in himalaya, catch the train and go
to siliguri.

799
01:32:52,826 --> 01:32:57,969
..from there in bus to gangtok..
from there..

800
01:32:58,191 --> 01:33:01,270
by foot. it would take 8 days.

801
01:33:01,858 --> 01:33:06,239
In kanchenjunga mountain there is a
huge god's temple.

802
01:33:07,509 --> 01:33:08,445
go there.

803
01:33:09,303 --> 01:33:11,017
your job will be done.

804
01:33:11,128 --> 01:33:13,477
its a wrong number.

805
01:33:13,557 --> 01:33:14,271
what it is?

806
01:33:14,271 --> 01:33:15,461
wrong number.

807
01:33:15,668 --> 01:33:21,049
tapasvi ji. the technology you are using to reach
god is fused.

808
01:33:21,588 --> 01:33:23,795
all calls are reaching to wrong number.

809
01:33:24,207 --> 01:33:27,993
..and there is a duplicate god sitting there
who is duping you.

810
01:33:28,041 --> 01:33:31,501
what..what are you trying to say?

811
01:33:31,613 --> 01:33:34,422
i'll explain.
we all are god's child right?

812
01:33:35,152 --> 01:33:36,041
yes. so?

813
01:33:36,295 --> 01:33:39,914
..so if your child comes to you with his problem.
what would you do?

814
01:33:40,469 --> 01:33:41,819
solve his problem. yes?

815
01:33:42,025 --> 01:33:46,869
or would you say..
2000 km. away i have one more house.

816
01:33:46,869 --> 01:33:50,009
visit me there and explain me the same
problem once again.

817
01:33:50,056 --> 01:33:52,294
then i will resolve. how illogical.

818
01:33:53,256 --> 01:33:58,151
if call would have reached the right god,
he must have said take care of her.

819
01:33:58,421 --> 01:34:00,754
why left her and chasing me?

820
01:34:00,961 --> 01:34:06,257
once you will die, we will meet.
atleast now spend time with her.

821
01:34:06,818 --> 01:34:08,009
right?

822
01:34:12,183 --> 01:34:17,009
i can prove. someone is duping here.
call the god again.

823
01:34:17,135 --> 01:34:21,796
do you give guarantee that aunty will
be fine?

824
01:34:21,913 --> 01:34:25,231
uncle, get written confirmation first.
don't leave aunty without it.

825
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:28,072
call now. everything will be clarified.

826
01:34:29,582 --> 01:34:32,851
its time for tapasvi ji's silence meditation.

827
01:34:47,383 --> 01:34:51,383
that duplicate god told you that
my thing is yours.

828
01:34:55,637 --> 01:34:57,700
its not god, but fraud.

829
01:34:58,605 --> 01:35:01,684
its fraud.

830
01:35:01,811 --> 01:35:05,319
till now nobody has seen or heard about god.

831
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:09,256
what god wants, his managers tell us.

832
01:35:09,811 --> 01:35:12,065
Pk raised an important question today.
what?

833
01:35:14,335 --> 01:35:17,970
Do god really hear his managers.

834
01:35:18,033 --> 01:35:18,541
no

835
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:23,208
the solutions is created by god or any fraud.

836
01:35:23,381 --> 01:35:24,859
coming from wrong number.

837
01:35:24,889 --> 01:35:27,460
so pk what should public do?

838
01:35:27,492 --> 01:35:32,429
till the telephone problem fixed.
talk to each other and resolve problems.

839
01:35:32,651 --> 01:35:33,905
help each other.

840
01:35:34,286 --> 01:35:35,381
pk has a point.

841
01:35:35,921 --> 01:35:40,461
we should boycott these managers.

842
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:44,476
instead support each other. just like...

843
01:35:51,886 --> 01:35:56,236
pk says this temple should not be build because
that object is his.

844
01:35:56,252 --> 01:35:57,442
what's in your pocket?

845
01:36:00,632 --> 01:36:01,982
you smoke?

846
01:36:02,982 --> 01:36:03,712
yes

847
01:36:03,934 --> 01:36:05,458
and alcohol too.right?

848
01:36:07,045 --> 01:36:08,013
occasionally.

849
01:36:08,299 --> 01:36:14,886
you drink and smoke after knowing that it kills.

850
01:36:15,902 --> 01:36:17,775
government gives permit.

851
01:36:18,712 --> 01:36:24,633
factory makes this poison.
its sold opening in shops.

852
01:36:24,633 --> 01:36:26,960
..yet nobody objects.

853
01:36:27,008 --> 01:36:40,339
when in this holy ground we want to construct
a temple then why objections?

854
01:36:40,595 --> 01:36:48,895
if you want to ask question, ask PK.

855
01:36:50,038 --> 01:36:52,260
is he muslim?

856
01:36:53,133 --> 01:36:55,552
or some anti hindu religion?

857
01:36:56,101 --> 01:37:04,181
you must ask PK these questions.
and about his religion.

858
01:37:11,734 --> 01:37:14,353
mehmood gajni came many years ago.

859
01:37:15,544 --> 01:37:22,909
..to destroy temples.
today once again somebody came.

860
01:37:51,687 --> 01:37:53,369
can you call your god?

861
01:37:53,861 --> 01:37:58,639
he wants to know my religion right?
first ask him what religion do their these
kids have.

862
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:00,687
is it a joke?

863
01:38:00,703 --> 01:38:03,052
call me and ask.

864
01:38:03,163 --> 01:38:07,004
its easy even i can answer.

865
01:38:07,353 --> 01:38:14,528
he's christian, he's sikh, he's jain and
she's from your cast.

866
01:38:16,066 --> 01:38:19,146
could you reveal now?

867
01:38:19,258 --> 01:38:23,264
hello, i am sikh.

868
01:38:23,391 --> 01:38:25,925
i am muslim.

869
01:38:24,407 --> 01:38:26,732


870
01:38:26,464 --> 01:38:28,068
i am jain.

871
01:38:28,052 --> 01:38:30,575
i am christian.

872
01:38:31,195 --> 01:38:35,249
and i am jagat janani. sikh.

873
01:38:35,592 --> 01:38:40,401
confused?
i changed their cloths randomly.

874
01:38:41,116 --> 01:38:43,671
religion connection is with fashion.

875
01:38:43,862 --> 01:38:46,401
let me show you.

876
01:38:46,703 --> 01:38:49,783
beard and moustache means
sikh.

877
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:52,734
take out turban so hindu.

878
01:38:52,846 --> 01:38:56,545
if exclude moustache
then muslim.

879
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,005
This difference is made by wrong numbered
god.

880
01:39:00,053 --> 01:39:04,275
had it been real god. he would have put
his stamp on your body.
do you have any?

881
01:39:04,338 --> 01:39:05,021
mine?

882
01:39:05,037 --> 01:39:08,735
what are you gazing? take off your
cloths and check.

883
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:11,037
why shy?

884
01:39:11,196 --> 01:39:16,611
come on all for tapasvi ji.. take off cloths and
check your body for stamp.

885
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,371
why shy? ok i do first.

886
01:39:23,323 --> 01:39:24,244
watch.

887
01:39:27,121 --> 01:39:31,642
do you see any religious stamp?

888
01:39:32,343 --> 01:39:36,168
do you see? wait let me take off...

889
01:39:36,232 --> 01:39:37,676
security.

890
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:43,470
what are you doing?
let me prove.

891
01:39:48,358 --> 01:39:50,501
that's not god's object.

892
01:39:59,056 --> 01:39:59,818
jaggu.

893
01:40:01,215 --> 01:40:02,659
finish this.

894
01:40:06,342 --> 01:40:10,246
you were 40 days old when tapasvi gave
you your name.

895
01:40:10,675 --> 01:40:14,723
keep in mind he can give name,
then ruin your name too.

896
01:40:15,072 --> 01:40:18,901
papa, he gave me the most ruined name.
jagat janani.

897
01:40:19,107 --> 01:40:22,742
you. how much money you want?

898
01:40:23,313 --> 01:40:26,202
-papa
-you're harassing tapasvi ji for money?

899
01:40:26,566 --> 01:40:27,139
no.

900
01:40:27,298 --> 01:40:32,325
you will burn in hell.
have some fear from god.

901
01:40:38,171 --> 01:40:41,377
thank you..papa. thank you.

902
01:40:41,441 --> 01:40:44,822
i had incomplete knowledge.
Now i know everything.

903
01:40:44,838 --> 01:40:52,439
this whole game is about fear.
wrong number god is not just duping but
taking advantage of our fear.

904
01:40:52,806 --> 01:40:55,552
whatever you know. could you
explain papa?

905
01:40:55,616 --> 01:41:00,276
ofcourse. come.

906
01:41:00,758 --> 01:41:03,155
i don't have time for this non-sense.

907
01:41:03,489 --> 01:41:07,949
papa. deal. if it'll turn out to be non-sense.
i will shut the show.

908
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:24,008
papa, this college has exams.
all students are terrified.

909
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:28,336
now we'll start here business from fear.
- come i will show.

910
01:41:40,196 --> 01:41:42,434
here's the machine in factory.

911
01:41:47,656 --> 01:41:50,008
some investment.

912
01:41:54,275 --> 01:41:58,615
here's the inauguration.

913
01:42:07,075 --> 01:42:08,091
now watch.

914
01:42:08,615 --> 01:42:11,619
in 15 minutes investment is double.

915
01:42:18,438 --> 01:42:19,899
there you go.

916
01:42:21,406 --> 01:42:23,073
this is how it begins.

917
01:42:23,645 --> 01:42:25,978
tea.. hot tea.

918
01:42:26,041 --> 01:42:30,485
look in tea business there is
more investment.

919
01:42:30,501 --> 01:42:34,009
bicycle, cup, sugar, tea-pot, gas etc.

920
01:42:34,009 --> 01:42:37,866
and here..a stone and red color.

921
01:42:38,024 --> 01:42:39,216
tea..tea..hot tea.

922
01:42:39,484 --> 01:42:41,854
there you need to call customers.

923
01:42:41,977 --> 01:42:45,180
and here you have to blow them away.

924
01:42:46,196 --> 01:42:49,790
move, give others chance too.

925
01:42:51,755 --> 01:42:54,540
there you need to bow to customers.

926
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:57,865
here customers bow to you.

927
01:42:59,945 --> 01:43:04,151
look,
if someone is really scared he'll lay down completely

928
01:43:04,421 --> 01:43:09,298
wrong number god is doing business.
business of fear.

929
01:43:09,468 --> 01:43:12,989
he knows, the one who scares
goes to temple.

930
01:43:13,071 --> 01:43:16,293
you are also very coward.
take this all off.

931
01:43:17,833 --> 01:43:20,214
don't stand against religion.

932
01:43:20,309 --> 01:43:21,627
its about faith.

933
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:29,599
if god wanted that we don't raise
questions then he wouldn't give us common sense.

934
01:43:29,742 --> 01:43:33,892
these religious businessmen when can't answer,
gets violent.

935
01:43:33,933 --> 01:43:37,836
scares us and surpress us.
but now we won't be quiet.

936
01:43:38,171 --> 01:43:42,497
now more pk will arise.

937
01:43:44,699 --> 01:43:53,540
friends, if you see anyone dialing wrong number,
make their video and send us. we'll broadcast it on tv.

938
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,398
ask questions, spread awareness

939
01:44:08,283 --> 01:44:15,585
one question, if you can emerge gold out of no where,
when why don't you help poor?

940
01:44:18,606 --> 01:44:23,761
when you can emerge gold by yourself,
then why ask donation from us?

941
01:44:29,127 --> 01:44:31,826
its a wrong number.

942
01:44:32,016 --> 01:44:39,662
- jaggu come with me.
- wait
- just come with me right now.

943
01:44:39,778 --> 01:44:45,583
you guys are on fire. whole world is sending
wrong number videos.

944
01:44:49,837 --> 01:45:01,625
they said feed cow and you'll get job.

950
01:45:18,923 --> 01:45:23,609

god has made only one masterplan for
whole universe.

954
01:45:34,494 --> 01:45:37,082
you must accept that.

955
01:45:37,113 --> 01:45:41,542
outside temple your followers are selling your
holy books in very cheap price.

956
01:45:41,542 --> 01:45:46,233
here if you read this 4 lines, you will have
a new born son.

957
01:45:46,304 --> 01:45:53,076
it means get a 10 rupee book, read 4 lines and screw up
the whole nature cycle.

958
01:46:01,862 --> 01:46:06,338
pk, your show is hit.

here, one more.

960
01:46:12,751 --> 01:46:13,878
what happend?

961
01:46:15,068 --> 01:46:19,161
dad sent message,
he is ashamed of me.

962
01:46:22,664 --> 01:46:31,765
i was very little when i wrote my first
 poem for dad.

963
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:39,169
i look like mother, says everyone.
its true.

964
01:46:39,169 --> 01:46:42,369
but i am the daughter of my daddy.

965
01:46:42,607 --> 01:46:44,529
i narrated this poem in annual day.

966
01:46:45,495 --> 01:46:47,290
every parents in the crowd, applaud.

967
01:46:47,909 --> 01:46:51,940
amongst those clapping, my dad was whistling
nonstop.

968
01:46:52,972 --> 01:46:57,130
clapping stopped, but whistling didn't.

969
01:46:58,305 --> 01:47:01,401
he was so proud of me.

970
01:47:03,782 --> 01:47:07,893
and today he wrote he is ashamed of me.

971
01:47:08,687 --> 01:47:14,542
he has some kind of illusion.

972
01:47:14,576 --> 01:47:21,048
the day he'll have clean mindset, he'll whistle
non stop yet again.

973
01:47:21,195 --> 01:47:22,608
that day will never come.

974
01:47:22,989 --> 01:47:29,893
knock it off, come.

 in sorrow in my planet.

gazing you, bearing you,
i forgotton everything and just follow you.

981
01:49:43,596 --> 01:49:49,724
this is such a waste of time,
love is a waste of time.

982
01:49:56,279 --> 01:50:09,089
then also i decided atleast once in this life,
i will waste my time. love is a waste of time.

983
01:50:32,436 --> 01:50:43,378

Now i am mandava,
but i am coming tomorrow along with a gift for you.

1007
01:55:50,654 --> 01:55:54,559
The theif who stole your thing is in my abduction.

1008
01:55:54,876 --> 01:55:57,717
he sold your stuff for 40000 rupees.

1009
01:55:57,797 --> 01:56:03,119
ask to who.
-to who
-to tapasvi ji.

1010
01:56:07,701 --> 01:56:11,051
god said its a broken piece of lord shiva's drum.

1011
01:56:13,242 --> 01:56:20,718
god said take it and situate it in a grand new
holy temple because its presence..

1012
01:56:22,691 --> 01:56:24,337
hello, what happened?

01:56:25,353 --> 01:56:28,369
the thief who stole my remote is caught.

1014
01:56:31,130 --> 01:56:36,686
brother said, theif sold it to tapasvi ji.

1015
01:56:36,749 --> 01:56:38,726
then tapasvi is in trouble.

01:56:38,924 --> 01:56:45,465
lets take thief to tapasvi ji, and ask him
to return remote otherwise we will reveal the truth
by theif on television.

1017
01:56:45,956 --> 01:56:49,019
tapasvi ji didn't find my remote in himalaya.

1018
01:56:49,114 --> 01:56:51,353
that means he is lying.

1019
01:56:54,177 --> 01:56:59,080
that means wrong number is spread by
tapasvi ji not duplicate god

1020
01:57:01,479 --> 01:57:03,955
did you know about that?

talked about wrong number?

1022
01:57:07,701 --> 01:57:12,717
whoever is trying to reach god, tapasvi ji
is dialing wrong number for them.

1023
01:57:12,717 --> 01:57:15,834
i knew in a second that you were
not doing it right.

1024
01:57:15,834 --> 01:57:21,231
but i didn't clear your confusion.
because if you call tapasvi ji fraud
his follower would've beaten you.

1025
01:57:21,231 --> 01:57:23,707
people needed an creative
solution.

1026
01:57:23,707 --> 01:57:25,342
hold on. that's wrong number.

1027
01:57:25,342 --> 01:57:28,183

02:06:32,559 --> 02:06:36,343
then who are you to take
their hope away?

1100
02:06:37,097 --> 02:06:37,970
and if..

1101
02:06:38,744 --> 02:06:45,850
..you really want to detach people from god,
then tell us what would you give us in return?

1102
02:06:46,434 --> 02:06:49,569
enough of these "wrong number" allegations.

1103
02:06:50,780 --> 02:06:55,995
instead tell us today what exactly is the
right number.

1104
02:07:04,607 --> 02:07:07,067
you are right

1105
02:07:08,258 --> 02:07:13,179
once even i didn't have food to eat..

1106
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:15,778
no place to live

1107
02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:18,258
i used to cry a lot

1108
02:07:19,329 --> 02:07:22,026
..as i didn't have any friends
either.

1109
02:07:23,515 --> 02:07:26,094
that time i only had one support

1110
02:07:28,614 --> 02:07:30,003
..God.

1111
02:07:31,610 --> 02:07:37,404
every morning felt like tomorrow
will be less worse, god will do something.

1112
02:07:39,797 --> 02:07:40,297
i agree..

1113
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:47,339
that believing in god gives hope.

1114
02:07:48,150 --> 02:07:52,309
..gets strength to cope with pain.

1115
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:57,379
but i have a question.

1116
02:07:58,638 --> 02:08:00,463
which god to trust?

1117
02:08:02,547 --> 02:08:05,067
you say god is one.

1118
02:08:07,090 --> 02:08:07,974
i say wrong..

1119
02:08:09,701 --> 02:08:10,994
there are two gods.

1120
02:08:12,657 --> 02:08:14,304
one who created us

1121
02:08:16,745 --> 02:08:19,542
..and second whom you created.

1122
02:08:21,585 --> 02:08:24,642
i don't know anything about the one
who created us.

1123
02:08:25,098 --> 02:08:26,804
but the one you created..

1124
02:08:27,062 --> 02:08:30,304
is exactly like you.

1125
02:08:30,369 --> 02:08:34,555
small, liar, corrupted, makes false
promises.

1126
02:08:34,932 --> 02:08:38,960
he meets rich quickly,
and makes poor wait in queue.

1127
02:08:39,139 --> 02:08:41,044
gets happy when appreciated.

1128
02:08:41,143 --> 02:08:43,456
frighten people over small things.

1129
02:08:44,607 --> 02:08:46,472
I have a simple point.

1130
02:08:48,437 --> 02:08:53,080
trust god who created us.

1131
02:08:54,806 --> 02:08:59,659
and strike out the fake god you created.

1132
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,873
and you think we'll stay quiet?

1133
02:09:08,191 --> 02:09:11,980
Son, we know how to protect our god.

1134
02:09:12,020 --> 02:09:13,449
you will protect god?

1135
02:09:15,495 --> 02:09:15,995
..you?

1136
02:09:16,763 --> 02:09:18,260
this planet very small

1137
02:09:18,946 --> 02:09:22,143
million bigger planets are out there in
space.

1138
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:29,003
and you are sitting in that small planet,
in small city, in small room, talks about protecting god?

1139
02:09:29,144 --> 02:09:31,593
the one who created this whole life?

1140
02:09:31,803 --> 02:09:33,980
he doesn't need your protection.

1141
02:09:34,878 --> 02:09:37,123
he can protect himself real good.

1142
02:09:39,766 --> 02:09:45,824
today somebody tried to protect their god 
and my friend died.

1143
02:09:46,432 --> 02:09:48,635
only this shoe is left.

1144
02:09:50,420 --> 02:09:56,134
stop protecting the god, or else in
this planet only shoes will be left, no humans.

1145
02:09:56,591 --> 02:09:58,156
one muslim blows a bomb

1146
02:09:59,242 --> 02:10:03,990
and one hindu guru is listening your lecture.

1147
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:04,940
nice.

1148
02:10:05,472 --> 02:10:11,020
where is the stamp to prove that you
are hindu and i am muslim?

1149
02:10:11,861 --> 02:10:14,446
this difference is created by mankind.

1150
02:10:14,849 --> 02:10:20,841
and that itself is the most dangerous wrong number
of this planet.

1151
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:24,472
due to this people die.

1152
02:10:24,571 --> 02:10:29,333
the same wrong number you struck in jaggu's
brain and separated her from sarfaraz.

1153
02:10:29,909 --> 02:10:31,133
what wrong number?

1154
02:10:31,218 --> 02:10:33,055
that sarfaraz is dishonest.

1155
02:10:33,193 --> 02:10:35,642
you told that muslims are dishonest.

1156
02:10:35,745 --> 02:10:38,800
so he cheated. where's the lie?

1157
02:10:38,820 --> 02:10:41,809
one second.
-no hang on. what is going on?

1158
02:10:42,173 --> 02:10:43,466
hang on one moment.

1159
02:10:43,959 --> 02:10:52,361
so you are telling me that my prediction was 
wrong?

1160
02:10:52,403 --> 02:10:53,594
duh, ofcourse.

1161
02:10:53,594 --> 02:10:54,646
then prove it.

1162
02:10:54,745 --> 02:10:59,586
prove it that my prediction was wrong.
and if you couldn't..

1163
02:10:59,963 --> 02:11:07,020
you would lay on my feet and beg for
forgiveness.

1164
02:11:07,512 --> 02:11:10,079
or if i prove it then?

1165
02:11:10,131 --> 02:11:11,162
pk don't.

1166
02:11:17,333 --> 02:11:19,139
then this is yours.

1167
02:11:25,162 --> 02:11:26,455
challenge accepted.

1168
02:11:27,404 --> 02:11:32,549
could we point the cameras at jagat janani?

1169
02:11:38,348 --> 02:11:45,786
we hope you would co-operate with us
and tell the truth.

1170
02:11:47,138 --> 02:11:52,434
you fell in love in belgium with a pakistani man.

1171
02:11:53,441 --> 02:11:55,087
yes or no?

1172
02:11:55,226 --> 02:11:57,826
why are you discussing my
 personal life in public?

1173
02:11:57,905 --> 02:12:04,036
on friday 3:21 pm i predicted that..

1174
02:12:04,175 --> 02:12:06,576
he'd deceive you.

1175
02:12:06,695 --> 02:12:07,647
and next day..

1176
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:13,473
you went to marriage registrar office,
but this man didn't come.

1177
02:12:13,610 --> 02:12:15,832
yes or no?

1178
02:12:16,090 --> 02:12:19,363
yes he didn't come.
now can you please stop this?

1179
02:12:20,376 --> 02:12:27,718
now..would you bring yourself to my feet,
or shall i bring my feel there?

1180
02:12:27,796 --> 02:12:29,293
sarfaraz didn't cheat.

1181
02:12:29,661 --> 02:12:31,368
pk let it go, please

1182
02:12:31,368 --> 02:12:34,148
no please tell everyone what exactly
happened.

1183
02:12:34,366 --> 02:12:35,140
pk please.

1184
02:12:35,378 --> 02:12:40,076
just once, 
for my sake.

1185
02:12:44,604 --> 02:12:49,306
I was waiting and a letter arrived.

1186
02:12:49,624 --> 02:12:51,733
did sarfaraz himself delivered?

1187
02:12:53,671 --> 02:12:54,564
no

1188
02:12:56,820 --> 02:12:58,744
he sent through a kid.

1189
02:12:58,784 --> 02:13:00,351
did it have any name on it?

1190
02:13:00,391 --> 02:13:01,264
noooo.

1191
02:13:01,304 --> 02:13:04,566
then how did you know it was sarfarz's
letter?

1192
02:13:07,653 --> 02:13:11,997
it could've been for some other woman.

1193
02:13:14,669 --> 02:13:16,846
place didn't have another woman?

1194
02:13:17,347 --> 02:13:20,467
there was one with a cat.

1195
02:13:21,554 --> 02:13:25,805
and she gave you cat to carry.

1196
02:13:26,951 --> 02:13:30,627
kid who delieved letter,
did he know you?

1197
02:13:30,919 --> 02:13:31,419
No

1198
02:13:31,494 --> 02:13:32,650
did you know him?

1199
02:13:33,240 --> 02:13:34,490
no

1200
02:13:34,867 --> 02:13:38,717
then how would he know that
he should give letter to you.

1201
02:13:40,038 --> 02:13:46,451
perhaps he's been told to deliver letter
to woman with cat.

1202
02:13:48,212 --> 02:13:52,134
he gave you letter. you read..

1203
02:13:52,319 --> 02:13:54,768
and didn't even call sarfaraz later?

1204
02:13:55,726 --> 02:13:57,331
did you call him?

1205
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:02,926
no. because tapasvi ji struck wrong
number in your brain.

1206
02:14:03,006 --> 02:14:06,220
that muslims are dishonest.

1207
02:14:06,318 --> 02:14:08,580
sarfaraz didn't cheat you jaggu.

1208
02:14:08,660 --> 02:14:10,089
what's going on here?

1209
02:14:10,446 --> 02:14:15,728
dog, cat.. you will keep inventing stories
and we'll stay quiet?

1210
02:14:15,835 --> 02:14:16,569
one moment.

1211
02:14:17,006 --> 02:14:20,990
the truth will be revealed now.
call sarfaraz.

1212
02:14:26,621 --> 02:14:29,630
the number does not exist.

1213
02:14:29,994 --> 02:14:34,558

02:15:12,150 --> 02:15:15,456

office?

1249
02:17:45,672 --> 02:17:48,132
why did you never call?

1250
02:17:48,192 --> 02:17:53,628
how could i ? I found your letter stating
never contact me.

1251
02:17:54,005 --> 02:17:57,166
I knew you had a huge pressure from
your family.

1252
02:17:57,696 --> 02:18:03,172
but not sure why i always felt you'd try to contact
me someday.

1253
02:18:05,950 --> 02:18:08,410
you are terribly late.

1254
02:18:09,621 --> 02:18:15,307
what i could've done?
I had wrong number.

1255
02:18:21,525 --> 02:18:24,402
just got a right number from a friend.

1256
02:18:51,095 --> 02:18:52,762
Thank you son.

1257
02:19:27,921 --> 02:19:30,063
hold this for a sec.

1258
02:19:53,592 --> 02:19:58,954
PK, you taking batteries with you?
- yes i don't get it there.

1259
02:19:58,994 --> 02:20:02,605
but what would you do with so many
batteries?

1260
02:20:02,882 --> 02:20:06,909
i'll listen to the voices recorded in cassettes.

1261
02:20:07,029 --> 02:20:08,390
what kind of voices?

1262
02:20:08,577 --> 02:20:13,220
voices of your earth's birds, crows and traffic.

1263
02:20:13,319 --> 02:20:15,360
you'd listen to traffic noise?

1264
02:20:16,633 --> 02:20:21,362
I would do that when i'll miss
your planet.

1265
02:20:23,021 --> 02:20:26,771
wait up, i have one more trunk to unload.

1266
02:20:26,922 --> 02:20:27,902
pk let it go.

1267
02:20:28,346 --> 02:20:32,882
how could i let it go? there are
more batteries.

1268
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:34,140
do you hear me?

1269
02:20:37,803 --> 02:20:42,076
driver, do you hear?

1270
02:20:54,627 --> 02:20:57,756
in your planet everyone has 
such weird ears?

1271
02:20:59,667 --> 02:21:02,643
everyone stays naked?

1272
02:21:03,199 --> 02:21:08,156
what are you looking at?
is there any dirt on my face?

1273
02:21:11,192 --> 02:21:17,555
you know i was in 10th when i wrote
my first poem?

1274
02:21:18,471 --> 02:21:19,327
for my dad.

1275
02:21:19,506 --> 02:21:27,688
i look like mother everybody says,
everybody says, they say truth..

1276
02:21:33,784 --> 02:21:39,225
poetry means less words, 
deep meaning.

1277
02:21:39,629 --> 02:21:42,447
by the way you are really cute.

1278
02:21:44,133 --> 02:21:48,920
one more toast for a friend, who...

1279
02:21:49,054 --> 02:21:50,074
[jaggu singing]

1280
02:21:53,352 --> 02:21:57,697
there wasn't any bird, crow or traffic..

1281
02:21:58,074 --> 02:22:01,667
every tape had only my voice.

1282
02:22:01,784 --> 02:22:06,053
[tape scrambling]

1283
02:22:15,777 --> 02:22:16,710
got it.

1284
02:22:22,574 --> 02:22:24,816
prick made me run a lot.

1285
02:22:28,368 --> 02:22:31,679
what did you record in it, pk?

1286
02:22:33,159 --> 02:22:36,373
told you so, bird, crow and traffic.

1287
02:22:47,662 --> 02:22:52,535
when ever your earth would rotate,
i will play this tape.

1288
02:22:55,075 --> 02:23:00,254
I will wave hand vigorously.

1289
02:23:00,372 --> 02:23:03,547
you also wave hand..

1290
02:23:04,519 --> 02:23:05,471
..if get time.

1291
02:23:07,031 --> 02:23:09,269
it doesn't have my voice right?

1292
02:23:10,166 --> 02:23:12,536
your voice...

1293
02:23:13,063 --> 02:23:13,995
it is.

1294
02:23:14,392 --> 02:23:17,924
one of your poetry is there.

1295
02:23:18,043 --> 02:23:21,977
only one poetry?

1296
02:23:23,888 --> 02:23:30,214
ofcourse, why would i waste my time completely on you?
 after all i don't love you.

1297
02:23:49,348 --> 02:23:51,389
he didn't look back even once.

1298
02:23:52,660 --> 02:23:54,837
perhaps he was hiding his tears.

1299
02:23:55,895 --> 02:23:59,844
he learned some and 
taught some.

1300
02:24:00,891 --> 02:24:03,443
he learned to lie.

1301
02:24:03,601 --> 02:24:08,848
and taught the true meaning of
love.

1302
02:24:09,137 --> 02:24:11,320
love me enough, to let me go.

1303
02:24:12,828 --> 02:24:18,689
he also came here without cloths..
just like a newborn child.

1304
02:24:19,375 --> 02:24:25,808
He also used to ask millions questions
just like a child.

1305
02:24:27,241 --> 02:24:28,531
and then oneday

1306
02:24:30,971 --> 02:24:33,154
he was gone.

1307
02:24:35,138 --> 02:24:39,291
around 4000 million k.m away.

1308
02:24:41,388 --> 02:24:44,860
at the end he gave me two
beautiful gifts.

1309
02:24:47,503 --> 02:24:48,534
sarfaraz

1310
02:24:50,419 --> 02:24:52,007
and my father.

1311
02:24:55,459 --> 02:25:00,399
i will gaze at his star till i am 
alive.

1312
02:25:01,255 --> 02:25:02,384
and wave.

1313
02:25:04,765 --> 02:25:08,118
i am sure he'll do the same.

1314
02:25:12,860 --> 02:25:13,932
i miss him.

1315
02:25:48,749 --> 02:25:50,218
one year later..

1316
02:25:54,583 --> 02:25:58,194
brothers in an hour we'll land
on earth.

1317
02:25:58,563 --> 02:26:01,103
don't forget what i taught you.

1318
02:26:01,361 --> 02:26:03,464
only four major points.

1319
02:26:03,603 --> 02:26:06,559
1. its prohibited to walk naked there.

1320
02:26:06,639 --> 02:26:11,611
this kissing stuff and naked tasks are
being performed unseen,
 behind four walls.

1321
02:26:11,691 --> 02:26:16,384
thing which is allowed in public are
fight, war and cussing etc.

1322
02:26:16,552 --> 02:26:19,964
2. biggest confusion here is language.

1323
02:26:20,043 --> 02:26:24,687
if you hear in market that i'd like
 chicken/fish.

1324
02:26:24,746 --> 02:26:27,933
that doesn't mean they love animals.

1325
02:26:27,992 --> 02:26:32,397
it means they'll eat them for lunch today.

1326
02:26:32,476 --> 02:26:37,813
we will research why there is a difference
 in what they speak and think.

1327
02:26:37,952 --> 02:26:41,631
3. we'll steal cloths from the dancing car
right after landing.

1328
02:26:41,694 --> 02:26:44,789
then please insert your remote in your
underwear.

1329
02:26:44,849 --> 02:26:49,099
..really really deep inside.
don't want anyone to steal.

1330
02:26:49,234 --> 02:26:57,066
and 4. most importantly if you meet someone
who says he can help you contacting God.

1331
02:26:57,150 --> 02:27:03,427
..then to hell with research. just take a U-turn
and run for your life in full speed.

1332
02:27:14,657 --> 02:27:16,834
come bro, don't be scared. come.

1333
02:27:20,799 --> 02:27:24,014
what for you gazing? eh?

1334
02:27:25,105 --> 02:27:26,653
I have a question.

1335
02:27:27,227 --> 02:27:28,061
what?

1336
02:27:28,696 --> 02:27:34,089
last time how many times you
got beaten up?

1337
02:27:41,537 --> 02:27:42,708
what's that for?

1338
02:27:42,748 --> 02:27:43,978
self defense.

1339
02:27:45,220 --> 02:27:46,708
aha, safety!

1340
02:27:46,946 --> 02:27:48,579
let's go
-yes let's go.

1341
02:27:48,692 --> 02:27:51,628
not that direction.
this direction...

1342
02:27:51,740 --> 02:27:54,121
