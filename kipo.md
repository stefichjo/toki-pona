## Particles

ᴋɪᴘᴏ combines **pi** with predicates.

| | ᴋɪᴘᴏ | ꜱᴏɴᴊᴀ |
|:-|:-|:-|
| *the person that went home* | **jan pi tawa tomo** | **jan li tawa tomo. ona li ...** |

ᴋɪᴘᴏ prefixes a **li**-sentence with an "optative" **o**.

| | ᴋɪᴘᴏ | ꜱᴏɴᴊᴀ |
|:-|:-|:-|
| *May she sleep well.* | **o ona li lape pona.** | **ona o lape pona.** |

## Prepositions

When ᴋɪᴘᴏ turns a prepositions into a noun, the noun can have the meaning of the preposition's argument.

| | ᴋɪᴘᴏ | ꜱᴏɴᴊᴀ/ᴛᴇᴘᴀɴ |
|:-|:-|:-|
| *tool* | **kepeken** | **ilo** |
| *location*, *address* | **lon** | **ijo** (context) |
| *origin*, *source*, *cause*, *reason*, *motive* | **tan** | **mama** |
| *destination*, *target*, *goal* | **tawa** | **pini** |

ᴋɪᴘᴏ describes **sama** as a reflexive or reciprocal pronoun. (Presumably **sama** could translated as *original* (*what something is like*) and could therefore be used as reflexive or reciprocal pronoun.)

| | ᴋɪᴘᴏ | ᴛᴇᴘᴀɴ |
|:-|:-|:-|
| *She sees herself.*/*They see each other.* | **ona li lukin e sama.** | **ona li lukin e ona sama.** |

ᴋɪᴘᴏ describes **pu** (whithout calling it *official*) as *the Toki Pona book (possibly derogatorily)*. (Apparently, **pu** might be used as a preposition meaning *following*, *according to*. As a noun, it could then mean *what is being followed* and so on.)

| | ᴋɪᴘᴏ | ᴛᴇᴘᴀɴ |
|:-|:-|:-|
| *the (official) Toki Pona book* | **pu** | **lipu Pu** |

### poka

ᴋɪᴘᴏ describes **poka** as a preposition. (ᴋɪᴘᴏ also describes **sike**, **taso** and **weka** as prepositions.)

| | ᴋɪᴘᴏ | ꜱᴏɴᴊᴀ |
|:-|:-|:-|
| *I'm walking next to you.* | **mi tawa, poka sina.** | **mi tawa lon poka sina.** |

### e

ᴋɪᴘᴏ turns prepositional phrases into transitive verbs. This is unnecessarily ᴜɴ-ᴘᴏɴᴀ, but does make sense.

| | ᴋɪᴘᴏ | ꜱᴏɴᴊᴀ |
|:-|:-|:-|
| *Where did you put the clock?* | **sina lon seme e ilo tenpo?** | **sina pana e ilo tenpo lon seme?** |

## Content Words

ᴋɪᴘᴏ often extends the meaning of an adjective as a noun. In most cases, the intended meaning could be easily expressed adding a word or two before the adjective.

| | ᴋɪᴘᴏ | ꜱᴏɴᴊᴀ/ᴛᴇᴘᴀɴ |
|:-|:-|:-|
| *foreigner*, *stranger* | **ante** | **jan pi ma ante** |
| *preserves*, *canned goods* | **awen** | **moku awen** |
| *news* | **sin** | **toki (pi ijo sin)** |

When **jaki** and **pimeja** become nouns, they appear as if an **ijo** went missing. Apparently, this makes sense, if they mean something primordial (from a human perspective) like **suno**, **sewi**, **seli** and so on.

| | ᴋɪᴘᴏ | ᴛᴇᴘᴀɴ |
|:-|:-|:-|
| *dirt*, *garbage*, *pollution* | **jaki** | **(ijo) jaki** |
| *poison* | **jaki** (?) | **jaki** |
| *shadow* | **pimeja** | **pimeja** |
| *pair*, *duo* | **tu** | **tu** |
| *unit, element* | **wan** | **wan** |
| *particle*, *part*, *piece* | **wan** | **lili** |

## Punctuation

ᴋɪᴘᴏ uses commas to add phrases (where they don't belong).

| | ᴋɪᴘᴏ | ꜱᴏɴᴊᴀ |
|:-|:-|:-|
| *I give you a room.* | **mi pana e tomo, tawa sina.** | **mi pana e tomo tawa sina.** |
| *many men of Athens* | **jan pi ma Asina, mute** | **jan mute pi ma Asina** |

ᴋɪᴘᴏ uses a hiphen to denote the end of a sentence after **ni:**.

| | ᴋɪᴘᴏ | ꜱᴏɴᴊᴀ |
|:-|:-|:-|
| *I know that Tom is happy.* | **mi sona e ni: jan Ton li pilin pona-.** | **mi sona e ni: jan Ton li pilin pona.** |
